## 1.01 Explain the basic CHARACTERISTICS of a PROJECT and various METHODOLOGIES and FRAMEWORKS used in IT projects

- Characteristics of a project::_Start and finish_
  - Start and Finish: Every project has a defined beginning and end, with measurable deliverables.
  - Every project must meet three criteria: it is unique, has a specific reason or purpose, and is temporary, meaning it must have a start and finish.
- Characteristics of a project::_Unique_
  - Unique: Each project is distinct, with specific goals, requirements, and resources.
- Characteristics of a project::_Reason/purpose_
  - Reason/Purpose: A project addresses a particular need or solves a problem, aiming to achieve a valuable outcome.
- Characteristics of a project::_Project as part of a program_
  - Project as part of a Program: Programs group related projects that collectively contribute to a broader strategic objective.
  - A program gathers several related projects to accomplish a big goal. Programs last longer than projects because they **run from the start of the first project to the end of the last project**.
  - You must collaborate with other project teams and the program manager.
  - You need to ensure your deliverables and schedule align with the program's plan and requirements.
- Characteristics of a project::_Project as part of a portfolio_
  - Project as part of a Portfolio: A portfolio **manages all the organization's projects**, balancing resources and optimizing their contribution to **strategic goals**.
  - The main **difference between portfolios and programs** is that **projects within a program are related to the program's objective**. Projects **within a portfolio do not need to be related**; they share a portfolio because they exist in the same arbitrary group of approved projects.
- Methodologies and frameworks::_DevSecOps_
  - **DevSecOps Main Focus**: Integrates security considerations into the entire software development lifecycle.
  - DevSecOps: Baking Security into DevOps for Faster, **Secure Software Delivery**
    - DevSecOps: **Integrates security throughout the DevOps pipeline**, automating checks and tests along with development and operations.
    - Shared Responsibility: Security is everyone's job, not just a dedicated team's. This requires a cultural shift from centralized "security gurus" to decentralized ownership.
    - Challenges: Users may need support and training, security teams must relinquish control, and frequent deployments create higher security demands.
    - Benefits: Faster delivery, continuous security feedback, and reduced risk of breaches.
    - Importance: Secure systems are crucial for consumer trust, competitive advantage, and regulatory compliance.
- Methodologies and frameworks::_DevOps_
  - DevOps: Integrate development and operations to facilitate quick feedback and evolution of software product.
    - Promotes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to streamline software delivery.
  - Problem: Siloed development and operations teams create communication barriers, inefficiencies, and slow code delivery.
  - Solution: DevOps integrates these teams, practices, and tools to optimize the entire software delivery process.
  - Key features:
    - Collaboration: Developers and operations work together on the same team.
    - Automation: CI/CD automates builds, tests, and deployments for faster releases.
    - Continuous feedback: Early detection and fix of bugs through frequent integration and monitoring.
  - CI/CD:
    - Continuous Integration: Developers merge code frequently, triggering automated tests for early feedback.
    - Continuous Delivery: Code automatically prepared for release but deployment is manual (strategic control).
    - Continuous Deployment: Code automatically released to production after integration and testing.
  - Strengths:
    - Faster delivery of quality software.
    - Improved operational support and cross-functional collaboration.

## 1.02 Compare and contrast AGILE vs. WATERFALL concepts

- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::_Requirements_
  - Requirements: Highly changeable requirements favor agile methods like Scrum or Kanban, where adaptations happen easily. Waterfall methodology may struggle with frequent changes.
  - Define what the project delivers, how it works, and how it's used.
  - Create a shared understanding for stakeholders and team members.
  - Need to be precise and well-defined (regardless of methodology).
  - **Waterfall**:
    - Requirements upfront: All features listed before development starts.
    - Limited flexibility: Changes cost time and money.
    - Missed opportunities: Can't easily incorporate new ideas discovered during development.
  - **Agile**:
    - Progressive elaboration: Requirements evolve in iterations with frequent customer feedback.
    - Faster adaptation: Easily incorporate new ideas and respond to changing needs.
    - Reduced risk: Early feedback minimizes wasted effort on incorrect features.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::_Budget_
  - Budget: Agile methods typically work within flexible budgets, adapting features based on available resources. Waterfall requires a fixed budget with clear scope.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::_ScheDdule_
  - Schedule: Agile methods embrace iterative development, potentially adapting deadlines with each iteration. Waterfall follows a predefined schedule with less room for adjustment.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::_Cultural_
  - Cultural: Collaborative cultures thrive in agile settings, while top-down structures work better with Waterfall.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::_Developmental_
  - Developmental: Complex projects or unfamiliar technology might benefit from Waterfall's structured approach. Agile methods excel in iterative development for evolving technologies.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::_Industry standards_
  - Industry Standards: Some industries (e.g., government) may have regulations impacting methodology choice.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Team composition::Product ownership::_Roles and responsibilities_
  - Product Ownership: Agile methods rely on a designated product owner to prioritize backlog items and represent business needs. Waterfall focuses on project managers defining deliverables.
  - Roles and Responsibilities: Agile teams involve cross-functional members with shared responsibility. Waterfall often has designated roles with distinct tasks.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Team composition::Product ownership::_Team size_
  - Team Size: Smaller teams tend to fit agile methods well due to close collaboration. Waterfall can manage larger teams with defined roles and communication structure.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Team composition::Product ownership::_Resource allocation and commitment_
  - Resource Allocation and Commitment: Agile methods require flexible resource allocation, adapting to changing task priorities. Waterfall expects pre-determined resource commitment based on the fixed plan.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::_Differences in communication methods_
  - Agile: Frequent, informal communication through daily stand-up meetings, backlog updates, and collaborative tools.
  - Waterfall: More formal communication through reports, documentation, and structured meetings.
