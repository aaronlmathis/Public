## 1.1 Syllabus listed definition (2 questions on ITIL 4 exam)

  - The role that **defines the requirements for a service** and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.
  - customer: takes a service, and uses it for their own purposes.
  - user: end user of service.
  - sponsor: provides the money.
  - e.g. purchase phone:
    - customer: takes phone and uses it to make calls, text...
    - user: end user of phone.
    - sponsor: pays for the monthly phone plan.
- **service**
  - A means of enabling value co-creation by **facilitating outcomes that customers wants**, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
  - The customer does not want to worry about how the service gets to them. customer doesn't care how the company manages risk, compliance..., they just want the service.
- **service management**
  - A set of specialized **organizational capabilities for enabling value** for customers in the form of services.

- **utility**
  - The **functionality** offered by a **product or service** to meet a particular need. Utility can be summarized as ‘what the service does’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for purpose’. To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.
- **warranty**
  - Assurance that a product or service will **meet agreed requirements**. Warranty can be summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for use’. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image. **Warranty typically addresses** such areas as the **availability** of the service, its **capacity**, levels of **security**, and **continuity**. A service may be said to provide acceptable assurance, or ‘warranty’, if all **defined and agreed conditions are met**.

    a. Service: A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
    b. Service management: A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services.

Warranty can be summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is 'fit for use'. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image.
