# D426 Database Management Foundations Terms

## 1.1 Database basics

- **Data**
  - Data is numeric, textual, visual, or audio information that describes real-world systems.
- **analog**
  - Historically, data was mostly analog, encoded as continuous variations on various physical media.
- **digital**
  - Today, data is mostly digital, encoded as zeros and ones on electronic and magnetic media.
- **database**
  - A database is a collection of data in a structured format. In principle, databases can be stored on paper or even clay tablets. In practice, however, modern databases are invariably stored on computers.
- **database system / database management system / DBMS**
  - A database system, also known as a database management system or DBMS, is software that reads and writes data in a database. Database systems ensure data is secure, internally consistent, and available at all times. These functions are challenging for large databases with many users, so database systems are complex.
- **query language**
  - A query language is a specialized programming language, designed specifically for database systems.
- **database application**
  - A database application is software that helps business users interact with database systems.
- **database administrator**
  - A database administrator is responsible for securing the database system against unauthorized users. A database administrator enforces procedures for user access and database system availability.
- **database designer**
  - A database designer determines the format of each data element and the overall database structure. Database designers must balance several priorities, including storage, response time, and support for rules that govern the data. Since these priorities often conflict, database design is technically challenging.
- **database programmer**
  - A database programmer develops computer programs that utilize a database.
- **database user**
  - A database user is a consumer of data in a database. Database users request, update, or use stored data to generate reports or information. Database users usually access the database via applications but can also submit queries directly to the database system.

## 1.2 Database systems

- **Authorization**
  - . Many database users should have limited access to specific tables, columns, or rows of a database. Database systems authorize individual users to access specific data.
- **Rules**
  - Database systems ensure data is consistent with structural and business rules.
- **transaction**
  - A transaction is a group of queries that must be either completed or rejected as a whole. Execution of some, but not all, queries results in inconsistent or incorrect data.
- **architecture**
  - The architecture of a database system describes the internal components and the relationships between components.
- **query processor**
  - The query processor interprets queries, creates a plan to modify the database or retrieve data, and returns query results to the application.
- **query optimization**
  - The query processor performs query optimization to ensure the most efficient instructions are executed on the data.
- **storage manager**
  - The storage manager translates the query processor instructions into low-level file-system commands that modify or retrieve data.
- **indexes**
  - The storage manager uses indexes to quickly locate data.
- **transaction manager**
  - The transaction manager ensures transactions are properly executed.
- **Metadata**
  - Metadata is data about the database, such as column names and the number of rows in each table.
- **log**
  - The log is a file containing a complete record of all inserts, updates, and deletes processed by the database.
- **catalog / data dictionary**
  - The catalog, also known as a data dictionary, is a directory of tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects.
- **relational database**
  - A relational database stores data in tables, columns, and rows, similar to a spreadsheet.
  - Relational systems are ideal for databases that require an accurate record of every transaction, such as banking, airline reservation systems, and student records.
  - All relational database systems support the SQL query language.
- **SQL**
  - SQL stands for Structured Query Language and includes statements that read and write data, create and delete tables, and administer the database system.
  - All relational database systems support the SQL query language.
- **big data**
  - The growth of the internet in the 1990s generated massive volumes of online data, called big data, often with poorly structured or missing information.
  - MongoDB: big data, open source, noSQL
- **NoSQL**
  - The newer non-relational systems are called NoSQL, for 'not only SQL', and are optimized for big data.
  - MongoDB: big data, open source, noSQL
- **Open source**
  - Open source software is software that anyone can inspect, copy, and modify with no licensing fee.
  - MongoDB: big data, open source, noSQL

## 1.3 Query languages

- **query**
  - A query is a command for a database that typically inserts new data, retrieves data, updates data, or deletes data from a database.
- **query_language**
  - A query language is a computer programming language for writing database queries.
- **CRUD**
  - The four common queries are sometimes referred to as CRUD operations, an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
- **Structured Query Language / SQL**
  - Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the standard query language of relational database systems.
- **statement**
  - An SQL statement is a database command, such as a query that inserts, selects, updates, or deletes data.
- **INSERT**
  - `INSERT` inserts rows into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...)
                VALUES (DEFAULT, 'bob', 30, 150);
```

- **SELECT**
  - `SELECT` retrieves data from a table.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name; -- return all data from those columns.
```

- **UPDATE**
  - `UPDATE` modifies data in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET   column_name = 2
WHERE column_id = 3;
```

- **DELETE**
  - `DELETE` deletes rows from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; -- all rows deleted!
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value'; -- delete row
```

- **CREATE TABLE**
  - The SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a new table by specifying the table and column names.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  customerId    INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  first_name    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age           INT CHECK(age > 18)
  driverid      INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (customerId),
  FOREIGN KEY (LOCAL_COLUMN_NAME) REFERENCES TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME),
);
```

- **data type**
  - Each column is assigned a data type that indicates the format of column values. Data types can be numeric, textual, or complex.

## 1.4 Database design and programming

- **database design**
  - A database design is a specification of database objects such as tables, columns, data types, and indexes. Database design also refers to the process used to develop the specification.
- **analysis**
  - The analysis phase specifies database requirements without regard to a specific database system.
  - Requirements are represented as **entities, relationships, and attributes**.
- **ER diagrams**
  - Entities, relationships, and attributes are depicted in ER diagrams.
  - ![er diagram](img/er_diagram.PNG)
- **logical design**
  - The logical design phase implements database requirements in a specific database system.
  - For relational database systems, logical design converts entities, relationships, and attributes into **tables, keys, and columns**.
  - The logical design, as specified in SQL and depicted in a table diagram, is called a database **schema**.
  - ![logical diagram](img/logical_diagram.PNG)
- **key**
  - A key is a column used to identify individual rows of a table.
  - Tables, keys, and columns are specified in SQL with `CREATE TABLE` statements.
- **table diagram**
  - The logical design is depicted in a table diagram.
  - ![logical diagram](img/logical_diagram.PNG)
- **schema**
  - The logical design, as specified in SQL and depicted in a table diagram, is called a database schema.
- **physical design**
  - The physical design phase adds indexes and specifies how tables are organized on **storage media**.
  - Physical design affects query processing speed but never affects the query result.
- **data independence**
  - The principle that physical design never affects query results is called data independence.
  - Physical design affects query processing speed but never affects the query result.
  - When database designers modify indexes or row order, **applications run faster** or slower but **always generate the same results**.
- **application programming interface / API**
  - simplify the use of SQL with a general-purpose language.
  - An application programming interface, or API, is **a library of procedures or classes** that links a host programming language to a database.

## 1.5 MySQL

  - MySQL Enterprise is a paid edition for managing commercial databases. MySQL Enterprise includes MySQL Server and additional administrative applications.
- **root account**
  - The root account, the administrative account that has full control of MySQL.
- **MySQL Command-Line Client**
  - The MySQL Command-Line Client is a text interface **included in the MySQL Server download**. The Command-Line Client allows developers to connect to the database server, perform administrative functions, and execute SQL statements.
  - ![mysql](img/mysql.PNG)
  - The animation above shows the user typing SQL commands that use the 'world' database, a database that is usually installed with MySQL.
- **error code**
  - MySQL Server returns an error code and description when an **SQL statement is syntactically incorrect** or the **database cannot execute the statement**.
- **MySQL Workbench**
  - MySQL Workbench is installed with MySQL Server and allows developers to execute SQL commands using an editor.

## 2.01 Relational model

- **database model**
  - A database model is a conceptual framework for database systems, with three parts:
    - **Data structures** that prescribe how data is organized.
      - data structures form the backbone of efficient and organized information storage.
      - Each database model relies on specific structures to represent entities, attributes, and relationships, ensuring data integrity and facilitating smooth retrieval and manipulation.
      - e.g. relational model: primary key, foreign key, data types(INT, STRING...), indexes.
    - **Operations** that manipulate data structures.
    - **Rules** that govern valid data.
- **relational model**
  - The relational model is a database model based on a **tabular data structure**. The model was published in 1970 by E. F. Codd of IBM and released in commercial products around 1980. The data structure, operations, and rules are standardized in **SQL**, the **universal query language of relational databases**.
- **big data**
  - The rise of the internet in the 1990s generated big data, characterized by unprecedented data volumes and rapidly changing data structures.
- **set**
  - A set is an **unordered** collection of elements enclosed in braces.
  - e.g. {a, b, c} and {c, b, a} are the same, since sets are **not** ordered.
- **tuple**
  - A tuple is an **ordered** collection of elements enclosed in parentheses.
  - e.g. (a, b, c) and (c, b, a) are different, since tuples are ordered.
- **table**
  - A table has a name, a fixed **tuple of columns**, and a varying **set of rows**.
  - all these are the same: **Table, File, Relation**.
- **column**
  - A column has a name and a data type.
  - all these are the same: **Column, Field, Attribute**
- **row**
  - A row is an unnamed tuple of values. Each value corresponds to a column and belongs to the column's data type.
  - since rows are a set, rows have no inherit order.
  - all these are the same: **Row, Record, Tuple**
- **relational data type**
  - A data type is a named set of values, from which column values are drawn.
- **relational algebra**
  - These operations are collectively called relational algebra and are the theoretical foundation of the SQL language.
- **Relational rules**
  - Rules are logical constraints that ensure data is valid.
  - Relational rules are part of the relational model and govern data in every relational database.
- **Business rules**
  - Rules are logical constraints that ensure data is valid.
  - Business rules are based on business policy and specific to a particular database.
  - e.g. All rows of the 'Employee' table must have a valid entry in the 'DepartCode' column.
- **constraints**
  - Relational rules are implemented as SQL constraints and enforced by the database system.

## 2.02 Structured Query Language

- **Structured Query Language / SQL**
  - Structured Query Language (SQL) is a high-level computer language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data.
  - SQL is the standard language for relational databases, and is commonly supported in non-relational databases.
- **SQL Statement Literals: Strings, Numbers, Binary**
  - Explicit values that are string, numeric, or binary.
    - Strings must be surrounded by single quotes or double quotes. e.g. `'string' or "string"`.
    - Numeric. `123`
    - Binary values are represented with x'0' where the 0 is any hex value. e.g. `x'ofa2'`.
- **SQL Statement Keywords**
  - Words with special meaning.
  - e.g. `SELECT, FROM, WHERE`.
- **SQL Statement Identifiers**
  - Objects from the database like tables, columns...
  - e.g. `City, Name, Population`.
- **statement**
  - An SQL statement is a complete command composed of one or more clauses.
  - e.g. `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column > 1000`
- **clause**
  - A clause groups SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` with table names like City, column names like Name, and conditions like Population > 100000.
- **Data Definition Language**
  - Data Definition Language (DDL) defines the structure of the database.
  - `CREATE, ALTER, DROP`
- **Data Manipulation Language**
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML) manipulates data stored in a database.
  - `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`
- **Data Query Language**
  - Data Query Language (DQL) retrieves data from the database.
  - `SELECT`
- **Data Control Language**
  - Data Control Language (DCL) controls database user access.
  - `GRANT, REVOKE`
- **Data Transaction Language**
  - Data Transaction Language (DTL) manages database transactions.
  - `SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK, COMMIT`

## 2.03 Managing databases

- **database system instance**
  - A database system instance is a single executing copy of a database system. Personal computers usually run just one instance of a database system. Shared computers, such as computers used for cloud services, usually run multiple instances of a database system.
- **CREATE DATABASE database_name**
  - `CREATE DATABASE database_name` creates a new database.
- **DROP DATABASE database_name**
  - `DROP DATABASE database_name` deletes a database, including all tables in the database.
- **USE database_name**
  - `USE database_name` selects a default database for use in subsequent SQL statements.
- **SHOW DATABASES**
  - `SHOW DATABASES` lists all databases in the database system instance.
- **SHOW TABLES**
  - `SHOW TABLES` lists all tables in the default database.
- **SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name**
  - `SHOW COLUMNS` FROM table_name lists all columns in the table_name table of the default database.
- **SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name**
  - `SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name` shows the CREATE TABLE statement for the table_name table of the default database.

## 2.04 Tables

- **table**
  - A table has a name, a fixed sequence of columns(**tuple**), and a varying **set** of rows.
- **table rules**
  - Exactly one value per cell. A cell may not contain multiple values. Unknown data is represented with a special `NULL` value.
  - No duplicate column names. Duplicate column names are allowed in different tables, but not in the same table.
  - No duplicate rows. No two rows may have identical values in all columns.
  - **No row order**. Rows are not ordered. The organization of rows on a storage device, such as a disk drive, never affects query results.
    - **data independence**. Data independence allows database administrators to improve query performance by **changing the organization of data on storage devices**, without affecting query results.
- **column**
  - A column has a name and a data type.
- **row**
  - A row is an unnamed sequence of values. Each value corresponds to a column and belongs to the column's data type.
- **cell**
  - A cell is a single column of a single row.
- **empty table**
  - A table without rows is called an empty table.
- **data independence**
  - Rule 4 is called data independence.
- **CREATE TABLE**
  - DDL
  - The `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a new table by specifying the table name, column names, and column data types.
- **DROP TABLE**
  - DDL
  - The `DROP TABLE` statement deletes a table, along with all the table's rows, from a database.
  - `DROP TABLE TableName;`
- **ALTER TABLE**
  - DDL
  - The `ALTER TABLE` statement adds, deletes, or modifies columns on an existing table.

| ALTER TABLE clause | Description       | Syntax                                                                      |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADD                | Adds a column     | `ALTER TABLE TableName ADD ColumnName DataType;`                            |
| CHANGE             | Modifies a column | `ALTER TABLE TableName CHANGE CurrentColumnName NewColumnName NewDataType;` |
| DROP               | Deletes a column  | `ALTER TABLE TableName DROP ColumnName;`                                    |

## 2.05 Data types

- **data type**
  - A data type is a named set of values from which column values are drawn.
  - `INT` or `INTEGER` — positive and negative integer values.

## 2.06 Selecting rows

- **operator / operands**
  - An operator is a symbol that computes a value from one or more other values, called operands:
    - **Arithmetic operators** compute numeric values from numeric operands.
    - **Comparison operators** compute logical values TRUE or FALSE. Operands may be numeric, character, and other data types.
    - **Logical operators** compute logical values from logical operands.

| Operator   | Description                                                            | Example | Value |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :---- |
| +          | Adds two numeric values                                                | 4 + 3   | 7     |
| - (unary)  | Reverses the sign of one numeric value                                 | -(-2)   | 2     |
| - (binary) | Subtracts one numeric value from another                               | 11 - 5  | 6     |
| `*`        | Multiplies two numeric values                                          | 3 \* 5  | 15    |
| /          | Divides one numeric value by another                                   | 4 / 2   | 2     |
| % (modulo) | Divides one numeric value by another and returns the integer remainder | 5 % 2   | 1     |
| ^          | Raises one numeric value to the power of another                       | 5^2     | 25    |
| =          | Compares two values for equality                                       | 1 = 2   | FALSE |
| !=         | Compares two values for inequality                                     | 1 != 2  | TRUE  |

- **unary**
  - A unary operator has one operand.
  - `- (unary). Reverses the sign of one numeric value: -(-2) = 2`
- **binary**
  - A binary operator has two operands.
  - `- (binary). Subtracts one numeric value from another: 11 - 5 = 6`
- **expression**
  - An expression is a string of operators, operands, and parentheses that evaluates to a single value. Operands may be column names or fixed values. The value of an expression may be any data type.
  - e.g. `Salary > 34000 AND Department = 'Marketing'`
- **operator precedence**
  - Operators in an expression are evaluated in the order of operator precedence, shown in the table below. Operators of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. Regardless of operator precedence, expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated before any operators outside the parentheses are applied. PEDMAS.
- **SELECT / FROM**
  - The `SELECT` statement selects rows from a table. The statement has a `SELECT` clause and a FROM clause. The FROM clause specifies the table from which rows are selected. The `SELECT` clause specifies one or more expressions, separated by commas, that determine what values are returned for each row.
- **result table**
  - The `SELECT` statement returns a set of rows, called the result table.
- **LIMIT**
  - MySQL has a `LIMIT` clause that limits the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` statement.
- **condition**
  - A condition is an expression that evaluates to a logical value.
- **WHERE**
  - A `SELECT` statement has an optional `WHERE` clause that specifies a condition for selecting rows. A row is selected when the condition is TRUE for the row values. A row is omitted when the condition is either `FALSE` or `NULL`.

## 2.07 Null values

- **NULL**
  - `NULL` is a special value that represents either **unknown** or **inapplicable data**.
- **NOT NULL**
  - The `NOT NULL` constraint prevents a column from having a `NULL` value. Statements that insert `NULL`, or update a value to `NULL`, are automatically rejected. `NOT NULL` follows the column name and data type in a `CREATE TABLE` statement.
- **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**
  - Instead, the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators must be used to select `NULL` values. Value `IS NULL` returns `TRUE` when the value is `NULL`. Value `IS NOT NULL` returns `TRUE` when the value is not `NULL`.
- **truth tables**
  - The value of logical expressions containing `NULL` operands is defined in truth tables.

## 2.08 Inserting, updating, and deleting rows

- **MySQL INSERT**
  - The `INSERT` statement adds rows to a table.
  - `INSERT [INTO] TableName (Column1, Column2, ...) VALUES (Value1, Value2, ...);`
- **INSERT INTO**
  - The `INSERT INTO` clause names the table and columns where data is to be added. The keyword `INTO` is optional.
  - `INSERT [INTO] TableName (Column1, Column2, ...) VALUES (Value1, Value2, ...);`
- **VALUES**
  - The `VALUES` clause specifies the column values to be added.
  - `INSERT [INTO] TableName (Column1, Column2, ...) VALUES (Value1, Value2, ...);`
- **DEFAULT**
  - The optional `DEFAULT` keyword and default value follow the column name and data type in a `CREATE TABLE` statement. The column is assigned the default value, rather than NULL, when omitted from an INSERT statement.
- **MySQL UPDATE**
  - The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing rows in a table.
  - The `UPDATE` statement uses the `SET` clause to specify the new column values.
  - An optional `WHERE` clause specifies which rows are updated. Omitting the `WHERE` clause results in all rows being updated.

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET Name = 'Tom Snead',
    BirthDate = '2000-03-15'
WHERE ID = 5384;
```

- **SET**
  - The `UPDATE` statement uses the SET clause to specify the new column values.
- **DELETE**
  - The `DELETE` statement deletes existing rows in a table.
  - `DELETE FROM TableName WHERE condition;` -- delete rows that returns true.
  - `DELETE FROM TableName;` -- delete all rows.
- **FROM**
  - The `FROM` keyword is followed by the table name whose rows are to be deleted.
- **TRUNCATE**
  - The `TRUNCATE` statement **deletes all rows** from a table.
  - `TRUNCATE TABLE TableName;` -- delete all table rows.
- **MERGE**
  - selects data from one table, called the **source**, and inserts the data to another table, called the **target**.
  - MySQL does not support the `MERGE` statement.

## 2.09 Primary keys

- **primary key**
  - A primary key is a column, or group of columns, used to identify a row.
  - The primary key is usually the table's first column and appears on the left of table diagrams, but the position is not significant to the database.
  - **Primary keys (simple or composite) must be**:
    - `UNIQUE`. This rule ensures that each value identifies at most one row.
    - `NOT NULL`. This rule ensures that each value identifies at least one row.
- **simple primary key**
  - A simple primary key consists of a single column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID        SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   Name      VARCHAR(60),
   Salary    DECIMAL(7,2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

- **composite primary key**
  - A composite primary key consists of multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Family (
   ID           SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   Number       SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   Relationship VARCHAR(20),
   Name         VARCHAR(60),
   PRIMARY KEY(ID, Number)
);
```

- **Minimal**
  - Minimal. All primary key columns are necessary for uniqueness. When any column is removed, the resulting simple or composite column is no longer unique.
- **PRIMARY KEY**
  - The PRIMARY KEY constraint in a CREATE TABLE statement names the table's primary key. The PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that a column or group of columns is always unique and non-null.
- **auto-increment column**
  - An auto-increment column is a numeric column that is assigned an **automatically incrementing value** when a new row is inserted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID        SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
   Name      VARCHAR(60),
   BirthDate DATE,
   Salary    DECIMAL(7,2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

- **AUTO_INCREMENT**
  - The AUTO_INCREMENT keyword defines an auto-increment column. AUTO_INCREMENT follows the column's data type in a CREATE TABLE statement.
  - Database users occasionally make the following errors when inserting primary keys:
    - Inserting values for auto-increment primary keys.
    - Omitting values for primary keys that are not auto-increment columns.
    - MySQL allows insertion of a specific value to an auto-increment column. However, overriding auto-increment for a primary key is usually a mistake.

## 2.10 Foreign keys

- **foreign key**
  - A foreign key is a column, or group of columns, that refer to a primary key.
  - ![foreign key](img/foreign_key.PNG)
- **Referential integrity**
  - Referential integrity requires foreign key values must either be NULL or match some value of the referenced primary key.
- **FOREIGN KEY / REFERENCES**
  - A foreign key constraint is added to a `CREATE TABLE` statement with the `FOREIGN KEY` and `REFERENCES` keywords.
  - When a **foreign key constraint** is specified, the **database rejects insert, update, and delete** statements that **violate referential integrity**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
   Code      TINYINT UNSIGNED,
   Name      VARCHAR(20),
   ManagerID SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   PRIMARY KEY (Code),
   FOREIGN KEY (ManagerID) REFERENCES Employee(ID)
);
```

## 2.11 Referential integrity

- **fully NULL**
  - A fully NULL foreign key is a simple or composite foreign key in which **all columns** are `NULL`.
- **Referential integrity**
  - Referential integrity is a relational rule that requires foreign key values are either fully `NULL` or match some primary key value.
- **RESTRICT**
  - `RESTRICT` rejects an insert, update, or delete that violates referential integrity.
  - `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, and `SET DEFAULT` apply to **primary key** update and delete, and **foreign key** insert and update.
  - `CASCADE` applies to **primary key** update and delete only.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName(
    ID varchar(20),
    Enrollment INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY(Enrollment) REFERENCES table_name(column_name) ON DELETE `RESTRICT`
    );
```

- **SET NULL**
  - `SET NULL` sets invalid foreign keys to NULL.
  - `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, and `SET DEFAULT` apply to **primary key** update and delete, and **foreign key** insert and update.
  - `CASCADE` applies to **primary key** update and delete only.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName(
    ID varchar(20),
    Enrollment INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY(Enrollment) REFERENCES table_name(column_name) ON DELETE SET NULL
    );
```

- **SET DEFAULT**
  - `SET DEFAULT` sets invalid foreign keys to the foreign key default value.
  - `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, and `SET DEFAULT` apply to **primary key** update and delete, and **foreign key** insert and update.
  - `CASCADE` applies to **primary key** update and delete only.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName(
    ID varchar(20),
    Enrollment INT DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY(Enrollment) REFERENCES table_name(column_name) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
    );
```

- **CASCADE**
  - `CASCADE` propagates primary key changes to foreign keys.
  - If a primary key is deleted, rows containing matching foreign keys are deleted. If a primary key is updated, matching foreign keys are updated to the same value.
  - `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, and `SET DEFAULT` apply to **primary key** update and delete, and **foreign key** insert and update.
  - `CASCADE` applies to **primary key** update and delete only.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName(
    ID varchar(20),
    Enrollment INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY(Enrollment) REFERENCES table_name(column_name)
      ON DELETE CASCADE
      ON UPDATE CASCADE
    );
```

- **ON UPDATE / ON DELETE**
  - Actions are specified in the optional `ON UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` clauses of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. `ON UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` are followed by either `RESTRICT`, `SET` `NULL`, `SET DEFAULT`, or `CASCADE`.

## 2.12 Constraints

- **constraint**
  - A constraint is a rule that governs **allowable** values in a database. **Constraints are based on relational and business rules**.
  - The database automatically rejects insert, update, and delete statements that violate a constraint.
  - `NOT NULL`
  - `DEFAULT`
  - `PRIMARY KEY`
  - `FOREIGN KEY`
- **column constraint**
  - A column constraint appears after the column name and data type in a `CREATE TABLE` statement. Column constraints govern values in a single column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID             INT,
   Name           VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- NOT NULL, Column Constraint
   DepartmentCode INT DEFAULT 999,
   PRIMARY KEY (ID), -- Column or Table Constraint
   FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentCode) REFERENCES Department (Code) -- Table Constraint
);
```

- **table constraint**
  - A table constraint appears in a separate clause of a `CREATE TABLE` statement and governs values in one or more columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID             INT,
   Name           VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- NOT NULL, Column Constraint
   DepartmentCode INT DEFAULT 999,
   PRIMARY KEY (ID), -- Column or Table Constraint
   FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentCode) REFERENCES Department (Code) -- Table Constraint
);
```

- **UNIQUE**
  - The UNIQUE constraint ensures that values in a column, or group of columns, are unique.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID         SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   Name       VARCHAR(60),
   Extension  CHAR(4),
   Username   VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
   UNIQUE (Name, Extension),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

- **CHECK**
  - The CHECK constraint specifies an expression on one or more columns of a table. The constraint is violated when the expression is FALSE and satisfied when the expression is either TRUE or NULL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID        SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   Name      VARCHAR(60),
   BirthDate DATE,
   HireDate  DATE CHECK (HireDate >= '2000-01-01' AND HireDate <= '2019-12-31'),
   Size      VARCHAR(6) CHECK (Size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large')),
   CHECK (BirthDate < HireDate),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

- **CONSTRAINT**
  - Table constraints may be **named** using the optional `CONSTRAINT` keyword, followed by the constraint name and declaration
  - **Adding and dropping constraints**
    - Constraints are added and dropped with the `ALTER TABLE` TableName followed by an `ADD`, `DROP`, or `CHANGE` clause.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
   ID             INT,
   Name           VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   DepartmentCode INT DEFAULT 999,
  CONSTRAINT EmployeePK PRIMARY KEY (ID),
  CONSTRAINT EmployeeDepartmentFK FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentCode) REFERENCES Department (Code)
);

-- Query Statement
SELECT Column_Name, Constraint_Name
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeePK = 1;
```

## 3.1 Special operators and clauses

- **IN**
  - The `IN` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to determine if a value matches one of several values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE Language IN ('Dutch', 'Kongo', 'Albanian');
```

- **BETWEEN**
  - The `BETWEEN` operator provides an alternative way to determine if a value is between two other values. The operator is written value `BETWEEN` minValue `AND` maxValue and is equivalent to:
  - `value >= minValue AND value <= maxValue`.

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employee
WHERE HireDate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2020-01-01';
```

- **LIKE**
  - The LIKE operator, when used in a WHERE clause, matches text against a pattern using the two wildcard characters `%` and `_`.
  - `%` matches any number of characters. e.g. `LIKE 'L%t'` matches "Lt", "Lot", "Lift", and "Lol cat".
  - `_` matches exactly one character. e.g. `LIKE 'L_t`' matches "Lot" and "Lit" but not "Lt" and "Loot".

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE CountryCode LIKE 'A_W';
```

- **BINARY**
  - The `LIKE` operator performs case-insensitive pattern matching by default or case-sensitive pattern matching if followed by the `BINARY` keyword.
- **DISTINCT**
  - The `DISTINCT` clause is used with a `SELECT` statement to return only unique or 'distinct' values.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Language
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE IsOfficial = 'F';
```

- **ORDER BY**
  - The `ORDER BY` clause orders selected rows by one or more columns in ascending (alphabetic or increasing) order.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CountryLanguage
ORDER BY Language DESC;
```

- **DESC**
  - The `DESC` keyword with the `ORDER BY` clause orders rows in descending order.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CountryLanguage
ORDER BY Language DESC;
```

## 3.2 Simple functions

- **function / argument**
  - A function operates on an expression enclosed in parentheses, called an argument, and returns a value. Usually, the argument is a simple expression, such as a column name or fixed value. Some functions have several arguments, separated by commas, and a few have no arguments at all.
- **ABS()**
  - Returns the absolute value.
  - `SELECT ABS(-5); -- returns 5`
- **LOWER()**
  - returns lowercase.
  - `SELECT LOWER(MySQL); -- returns mysql`
- **TRIM()**
  - removes leading and trailing whitespace.
  - `SELECT TRIM('   hello   '); -- returns 'hello'`
- **HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND()**
  - returns hour or minute or second from timestamp.
  - `SELECT HOUR('22:11:45'); -- returns 22`

## 3.3 Aggregate functions

- **aggregate function**
  - An aggregate function processes values from a set of rows and returns a summary value.
- **COUNT()**
  - `COUNT()` counts the number of rows in the set.
- **MIN()**
  - `MIN()` finds the minimum value in the set.
- **MAX()**
  - `MAX()` finds the maximum value in the set.
- **SUM()**
  - `SUM()` sums all the values in the set.
- **AVG()**
  - `AVG()` computes the arithmetic mean of all the values in the set.
- **GROUP BY**
  - The `GROUP BY`clause consists of the GROUP BY keyword and one or more columns. Each simple or composite value of the column(s) becomes a group. The query computes the aggregate function separately, and returns one row, for each group.
- **HAVING**
  - The `HAVING` clause is used with the `GROUP BY` clause to **filter group results**.

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name
  HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name;
```

## 3.4 Join queries

- **join / left table / right table**
  - A join is a `SELECT` statement that **combines data from two tables**, known as the left table and right table, into a single result.
- **AS**
  - To simplify queries or result tables, a column name can be replaced with an **alias**. The alias follows the column name, separated by an optional `AS` keyword.
  - e.g. `SELECT some_long_column_name AS short_name`
- **join clause**
  - A join clause determines how a join query handles unmatched rows. Two common join clauses are:
- **INNER JOIN**
  - `INNER JOIN` selects **only matching** left and right table rows.
  - `INNER` is optional

```sql
SELECT
  column_name AS group,
  column_name2 AS supervisor
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.ID = t2.ID; -- only matching TRUE rows will be joined.
```

- **FULL JOIN**
  - `FULL JOIN` selects **all** left and right table rows, regardless of match.

```sql
SELECT
  column_name AS group,
  column_name2 AS supervisor
FROM table1 t1
FULL JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.ID = t2.ID; -- all rows from both tables will be joined.
```

- **ON**
  - The `ON` clause specifies the join columns.
- **LEFT JOIN**
  - `LEFT JOIN` selects **all left table rows**, but only matching right table rows.

```sql
SELECT
  column_name AS group,
  column_name2 AS supervisor
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.ID = t2.ID; -- all rows from t1 will be joined with matching rows from t2.
```

- **RIGHT JOIN**
  - `RIGHT JOIN` selects **all right table rows**, but only matching left table rows.
  - right join can be confusing, most avoid it's usage. You can switch the table order to `LEFT JOIN` the table of your choose.

```sql
SELECT
  column_name AS group,
  column_name2 AS supervisor
FROM table1 t1
RIGHT JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.ID = t2.ID; -- all rows from t2 will be joined with matching rows from t1.
```

- **outer join**
  - An outer join is **any join that selects unmatched rows**, including left, right, and full joins.
- **UNION**
  - The `UNION` keyword **combines the two results into one table**.

```sql
SELECT d.name, e.name
FROM Department d, Employee e
WHERE d.ID = e.ID
UNION -- both results will be one table.
SELECT name, NULL
FROM Department
WHERE column_name NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM Employee)
   OR column_name IS NULL;
```

## 3.5 Equijoins, self-joins, and cross-joins

- **equijoin**
  - An equijoin compares columns of two tables with the **=** operator.
- **non-equijoin**
  - A non-equijoin compares columns with an operator other than =, such as **< and >**.
- **self-join**
  - A self-join **joins a table to itself**.

| ID   | Name            | Manager |
| :--- | :-------------- | :------ |
| 2538 | Lisa Ellison    | 8820    |
| 5384 | Sam Snead       | 8820    |
| 6381 | Maria Rodriguez | 8820    |
| 8820 | Jiho Chen       | NULL    |

```sql
SELECT A.Name, B.Name
FROM table1 A
JOIN tab1e1 B -- same table
  ON B.ID = A.Manager;
```

- **cross-join**
  - A cross-join combines two tables **without comparing columns**.
- **CROSS JOIN**
  - A cross-join uses a `CROSS JOIN` clause **without** an `ON` clause.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2; -- join both tables.
```

## 3.6 Subqueries

- **subquery / nested query / inner query**
  - A subquery, sometimes called a **nested query** or **inner query**, is a query within another SQL query.
  - precedence order is higher. PEDMAS.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE Percentage IN
    (SELECT Percentage
    FROM table1
    WHERE column_name = 'ABW');
```

- **correlated**
  - A subquery is correlated when the subquery's `WHERE` clause references a column from the outer query.

```sql
SELECT Name, CountryCode, Population
FROM City C
WHERE Population >
    (SELECT AVG(Population)
    FROM City
    WHERE CountryCode = C.CountryCode); -- C.CountryCode references the first query.
```

- **alias**
  - An alias is a temporary name assigned to a column or table.
- **AS**
  - An alias is a temporary name assigned to a column or table.
  - The `AS` keyword follows a column or table name to **create an alias**.
- **EXISTS**
  - **Correlated subqueries** commonly use the `EXISTS` operator.
  - returns `TRUE` if a subquery selects at least one row and `FALSE` if **no rows** are selected.
- **NOT EXISTS**
  - The `NOT EXISTS` operator returns `TRUE` if a subquery selects **no rows** and `FALSE` if at least one row is selected.
- **flattening**
  - Replacing a subquery with an equivalent join is called flattening a query.
  - joins are usually faster.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE column_ID IN
   (SELECT column_ID
   FROM table2
   WHERE column_name != 'Business')
-- replace with
SELECT *
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.ID = t2.ID
WHERE column_name != 'Business'

```

## 3.8 View tables

- **view table / view query**
  - A view table is a table name associated with a `SELECT` statement, called the view query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ManagerView -- name of new view table
AS SELECT DepartmentName, EmployeeName AS ManagerName -- column names
   FROM Department, Employee
   WHERE ManagerID = EmployeeID;
```

- **CREATE VIEW**
  - The CREATE VIEW statement creates a view table and specifies the view name, query, and, optionally, column names. If column names are not specified, column names are the same as in the view query result table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ManagerView -- name of new view table
AS SELECT DepartmentName, EmployeeName AS ManagerName -- column names
   FROM Department, Employee
   WHERE ManagerID = EmployeeID;

-- to use it
SELECT ManagerName
FROM ManagerView
WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales';
```

- **base table**
  - A table specified in the view query's FROM clause is called a base table.
  - not normally stored after using.
- **materialized view**
  - A materialized view is a view for which **view table data is stored** at all times.
  - Whenever a view table changes, the corresponding view tables can also change, so materialized views must be refreshed.
- **WITH CHECK OPTION**
  - When `WITH CHECK OPTION` is specified, the database rejects inserts and updates that do not satisfy the view query `WHERE` clause, the database generates an error message that explains the violation.

```sql
CREATE VIEW SalesEmployee (ID, Name, Department)
AS SELECT *
    FROM Employee
    WHERE DepartmentCode = 51
WITH CHECK OPTION; -- any row not matching WHERE will throw error.
```

## 3.9 Relational algebra

- **relational algebra**
  - In his original paper on the relational model, E. F. Codd introduced formal operations for manipulating tables. Codd's operations, called relational algebra, have since been refined and are the theoretical foundation of SQL.
- **select operation**
  - The select operation selects table rows based on a logical expression. is equivalent to `SELECT * FROM Table WHERE expression`.
- **project operation**
  - The project operation selects table columns. The project operation is equivalent to `SELECT Column1, Column2, ... FROM Table`.
- **product operation**
  - The product operation combines two tables into one result. The result includes all columns and all combinations of rows from both tables. The product operation is written as and is equivalent to `SELECT * FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2`.
- **join**
  - The join operation, denoted with a "bowtie" symbol, is identical to a product followed by a select: `SELECT * FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON expression`.
- **theta join**
  - Because of theta notation, the join operation is sometimes called a theta join.
- **Compatible tables**
  - Compatible tables have the same number of columns with the same data types. Column names may be different.
- **set operations**
  - Union, intersect, and difference operate on compatible tables and, collectively, are called set operations.
- **union**
  - The union operation combines all rows of two compatible tables into a single table. Duplicate rows are excluded from the result table. The union operation is equivalent to `SELECT _ FROM Table1 UNION SELECT _ FROM Table2`.
- **Intersect**
  - Intersect operates on two compatible tables and returns only rows that appear in both tables. The intersect operation is equivalent to `SELECT _ FROM Table1 INTERSECT SELECT _ FROM Table2`.
- **difference**
  - The difference operation removes from a table all rows that appear in a second compatible table. The difference operation is equivalent to `SELECT _ FROM Table1 MINUS SELECT _ FROM Table2`.
- **rename operation**
  - The rename operation specifies new table and column names. The rename operation is written as
- **aggregate operation**
  - The aggregate operation applies aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(). The aggregate operation is equivalent to `SELECT GroupColumn, Function(Column) FROM Table GROUP BY GroupColumn`.
- **equivalent**
  - Relational algebra expressions are equivalent if the expressions operate on the same tables and generate the same result.
- **query optimizer / query execution plan**
  - A query optimizer converts an SQL query into a sequence of low-level database actions, called the query execution plan. The query execution plan specifies precisely how to process an SQL statement.
- **cost**
  - The cost of an operation is a numeric estimate of processing time. The cost estimate usually combines both storage media access and computation time in a single measure.

## 4.1 Entities, relationships, and attributes

- **entity-relationship model**
  - Database design begins with verbal or written requirements for the database. Requirements are formalized as an entity-relationship model and then implemented in SQL
  - An entity-relationship model is a **high-level representation of data requirements**, ignoring implementation details.
- **entity**
  - An entity is a person, place, product, concept, or activity.
  - ![entity](img/logical_diagram.PNG)
- **relationship**
  - A relationship is a statement about two entities.
  - ![entity](img/logical_diagram.PNG)
- **attribute**
  - An attribute is a descript­ive property of an entity.
  - ![entity](img/logical_diagram.PNG)
- **reflexive relationship**
  - A reflexive relationship **relates an entity to itself**.
  - ![reflexive relationship](img/reflexive_relationship.PNG)
- **entity-relationship diagram / ER diagram**
  - An entity-relationship diagram, commonly called an ER diagram, is a schematic picture of **entities, relationships, and attributes**.
  - Entities are drawn as rectangles.
  - ![entity](img/er_diagram.PNG)
- **glossary / data dictionary / repository**
  - A glossary, also known as a data dictionary or repository, documents additional detail in text format.
- **entity type**
  - An entity type is a **set of things**. Ex: All employees in a company.
- **relationship type**
  - A relationship type is a **set of related things**. Ex: Employee-Manages-Department is a set of (employee, department) pairs, where the employee manages the department.
- **attribute type**
  - An attribute type is a **set of values**. Ex: All employee salaries.
- **entity instance**
  - An entity instance is an **individual thing**. Ex: The employee Sam Snead.
- **relationship instance**
  - A relationship instance is a **statement about entity instances**. Ex: "Maria Rodriguez manages Sales." .
- **attribute instance**
  - An attribute instance is an **individual value**. Ex: The salary $35,000.
- **Analysis for Database Design**
  - Analysis develops an entity-relationship model, capturing **data requirements** while **ignoring implementation details**.
  - Analysis steps

| Step | Name                                             |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Discover entities, relationships, and attributes |
| 2    | Determine cardinality                            |
| 3    | Distinguish strong and weak entities             |
| 4    | Create supertype and subtype entities            |

- **Logical design**
  - Logical design **converts the entity-relationship model into tables, columns, and keys** for a particular database system.
  - Logical design steps

| Step | Name                    |
| :--- | :---------------------- |
| 5    | Implement entities      |
| 6    | Implement relationships |
| 7    | Implement attributes    |
| 8    | Apply normal form       |

- **Physical design**
  - Physical design **adds indexes** and specifies how tables are organized on **storage media**.

## 4.3 Cardinality

- **cardinality**
  - In entity-relationship modeling, cardinality refers to **maxima and minima of relationships** and attributes.
    - one-to-one.
    - one-to-many.
    - many-to-many.
  - ![relationship symbols](img/entity_relationships_symbols.PNG)
  - ![relationship symbols](img/entity_relationships.jpg)
- **Relationship maximum**
  - Relationship maximum is the **greatest number of instances** of one entity that can relate to a single instance of another entity.
  - one-to-many.
  - ![relationship symbols](img/entity_relationships.jpg)
- **singular / plural**
  - A related entity is singular when the maximum is one and plural when the maximum is many.
  - one-to-many
- **Relationship minimum**
  - Relationship minimum is the **least number of instances** of one entity that can relate to a single instance of another entity.
  - A relationship has two minima, one for each of the related entities.
  - one-to-one
  - ![entity relationship optional required](img/entity_relationship_optional_required.PNG)
- **optional / required**
  - A related entity is **optional when the minimum is zero** and **required when the minimum is one**.
  - ![entity relationship optional required](img/entity_relationship_optional_required.PNG)
- **Attribute maximum**
  - Attribute maximum is the greatest number of attribute values that can describe each entity instance.
  - Attribute maximum is usually specified as one (singular) or many (plural).
  - In ER diagrams, attribute maximum and minimum follow the attribute name. The minimum appears in parentheses.
  - ![attribute min max](img/attribute_minimum_maximum.PNG)
- **Attribute minimum**
  - Attribute minimum is the least number of attribute values that can describe each entity instance. Attribute minimum is usually specified as zero (optional) or one (required).
  - In ER diagrams, attribute maximum and minimum follow the attribute name. The minimum appears in parentheses.
  - ![attribute min max](img/attribute_minimum_maximum.PNG)
- **unique attribute**
  - Each value of a unique attribute describes at most one entity instance.

## 4.4 Strong and weak entities

- **identifying attribute**
  - An identifying attribute is unique, singular, and required.
- **identify**
  - Identifying attribute values correspond one-to-one to, or identify, entity instances.
- **strong entity**
  - A strong entity has one or more identifying attributes.
- **weak entity / identifying relationship / identifying entity**
  - A weak entity does not have an identifying attribute. Instead, a weak entity usually has a relationship, called an identifying relationship, to another entity, called an identifying entity. Cardinality of the identifying entity is 1(1).

## 4.5 Supertype and subtype entities

- **subtype entity / supertype entity**
  - A subtype entity is a subset of another entity type, called the supertype entity.
  - e.g. Managers are a subset of employees, so Manager is a subtype entity of the Employee supertype entity.
  - On ER diagrams, subtype entities are drawn within the supertype.
  - ![supertype entity](img/supertype_entity.PNG)
- **IsA relationship**
  - A supertype entity identifies its subtype entities. The identifying relationship is called an **IsA** relationship.
  - ![supertype entity](img/supertype_entity.PNG)
- **Similar entities**
  - Similar entities are entities that have many common attributes and relationships.
- **partition**
  - A partition of a supertype entity is a **group of mutually exclusive(belong to only one subtype entity) subtype entities**.
  - ![partition entity](img/partition_entity.PNG)
- **partition attribute**
  - Each partition corresponds to an optional partition attribute of the supertype entity.
  - ![partition entity](img/partition_entity.PNG)
- **Database Design**
  - After entities, relationships, attributes, cardinality, and strong and weak entities are determined, the database designer looks for supertype and subtype entities.
  - once Analysis id done, logical design converts an entity-relationship model to tables, columns, and keys for a specific database system.
  - Creating supertype and subtype entities is the last of four analysis steps:
    1. Discover entities, relationships, and attributes
    2. Determine cardinality
    3. Distinguish strong and weak entities
    4. Create supertype and subtype entities

## 4.6 Alternative modeling conventions

- **crow's foot notation**
  - Variations in cardinality conventions are common. One popular convention, called crow's foot notation, depicts cardinality as a circle (zero), a short line (one), or three short lines (many). The three short lines look like a bird's foot, hence the name "crow's foot notation".
  - ![entity relationship optional required](img/entity_relationship_optional_required.PNG)
  - ![relationship symbols](img/entity_relationships_symbols.PNG)
  - ![relationship symbols](img/entity_relationships.jpg)
- **subject area**
  - Decompose a complex model into a group of related entities, called a subject area.
- **independent / dependent**
  - Refer to strong entities as independent and weak entities as dependent.
- **Unified Modeling Language / UML**
  - Unified Modeling Language, or UML, is commonly used for software development. Software data structures are similar to database structures, so UML includes ER conventions.
- **IDEF1X**
  - IDEF1X stands for Information DEFinition version 1X. IDEF1X became popular, in part, due to early adoption by the United States Department of Defense.
- **Chen notation**
  - Chen notation appeared in an early ER modeling paper by Peter Chen. Chen notation is not standardized but often appears in literature and tools.
- **Intangible Entity**
  - documented in the data model, but not tracked with data in the database.

## 4.7 Implementing entities

- **Selecting Primary Keys**
  - stable: value should not change.
  - simple: easy to type and store.
  - meaningless: no descriptive information.
- **strong table**
  - A strong entity becomes a strong table. The primary key must be unique and non-NULL, and should be stable, simple, and meaningless. Single-column primary keys are best, but if no such column exists, a composite primary key may have the required properties.
- **artificial key**
  - An artificial key is a single-column primary **key created by the database designer** when no suitable single-column or composite primary key exists.
- **subtype table**
  - A subtype entity becomes a subtype table .
- **weak table**
  - A weak entity becomes a weak table. Primary key is composite

## 4.10 First, second, and third normal form

- **depends on**
  - **Column A depends on column B** means each B value is related to at most one A value.
- **functional dependence**
  - **Dependence of one column on another** is called functional dependence.
  - e.g.
    - Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
    - Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
    - Customer Name: Name of the customer.
    - Product: Purchased product details.
  - Customer Name is dependent on Customer ID. Knowing the Customer ID uniquely determines the Customer Name.
- **Multivalued dependence / join dependence**
  - Multivalued dependence and join dependence entail dependencies between three or more columns.
- **Redundancy**
  - Redundancy is the **repetition of related values** in a table.
- **Normal forms**
  - Normal forms are **rules for designing tables with less redundancy**.
- **first normal form**
  - Every cell of a table contains exactly one value. A table is in first normal form when, in addition, the table has a primary key.
- **second normal form**
  - A table is in second normal form when all non-key columns depend on the whole primary key.
- **third normal form**
  - Informally, a table is in third normal form when all non-key columns depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key. A formal definition appears elsewhere in this material.

## 4.11 Boyce-Codd normal form

- **candidate key / Minimal**
  - A candidate key is a simple or composite column that is unique and minimal. Minimal means all columns are necessary for uniqueness.
- **non-key**
  - A non-key column is a column that is not contained in a candidate key.
- **third normal form**
  - A table is in third normal form if, whenever a non-key column A depends on column B, then B is unique. Columns A and B may be simple or composite.
- **Boyce-Codd normal form**
  - Boyce-Codd normal form applies to all columns and eliminates redundancy.
  - In a Boyce-Codd normal form table, if column A depends on column B, then B must be unique.
  - Boyce-Codd normal form is ideal for **tables with frequent inserts, updates, and deletes**.
- **Trivial Dependencies**
  - When the columns of A are a subset of the columns of B, A always depends on B. Ex: FareClass depends on (FlightCode, FareClass). These dependencies are called trivial.

## 4.12 Applying normal form

- **Normalization**
  - Normalization eliminates redundancy by decomposing a table into two or more tables.
  - **redundancy is eliminated** with normalization, the **last step of logical design**.
- **depends on**
  - Column A depends on column B when each B value is related to at most one A value. A and B may be simple or composite columns.
- **Denormalization**
  - Denormalization means **intentionally introducing redundancy** by merging tables, to **eliminate `JOIN` queries**.

## 5.1 Storage media

- **Access time**
  - Access time is the time required to access the first byte in a read or write operation.
- **Transfer rate**
  - Transfer rate is the speed at which data is read or written, following initial access.
- **Volatile memory**
  - Volatile memory is memory that is lost when disconnected from power.
- **Non-volatile memory**
  - Non-volatile memory is retained without power.
- **Main memory / random-access memory (RAM)**
  - Main memory, also called random-access memory (RAM), is the primary memory used when computer programs execute.
- **Flash memory / solid-state drive (SSD)**
  - Flash memory, also called solid-state drive (SSD), is less expensive and higher capacity than main memory.
- **Magnetic disk / hard-disk drive (HDD)**
  - Magnetic disk, also called hard-disk drive (HDD), is used to store large amounts of data.
- **sectors**
  - Magnetic disk groups data in sectors, traditionally 512 bytes per sector but 4 kilobytes with newer disk formats.
- **pages**
  - Flash memory groups data in pages, usually between 2 kilobytes and 16 kilobytes per page.
- **block**
  - Databases and file systems use a uniform size, called a block, when transferring data between main memory and storage media.
- **row-oriented storage**
  - To minimize block transfers, relational databases usually store an entire row within one block, which is called row-oriented storage.
- **column-oriented / columnar storage**
  - In column-oriented storage, also called columnar storage, each block stores values for a single column only.

## 5.2 Table structures

- **table structure**
  - A table structure is a scheme for **organizing rows in blocks on storage media**.
  - Row-oriented storage performs better than column-oriented storage for most transactional databases. Consequently, relational databases commonly use row-oriented storage.
  - Alternate table structures:
    - **Heap** table
    - **Sorted** table
    - **Hash** table
    - **Table cluster**
- **heap table**
  - In a heap table, **no order is imposed on rows**.
  - Heap tables **optimize insert operations**. Heap tables are particularly **fast** for bulk load of many rows, since rows are stored in load order.
- **sorted table / sort column**
  - In a sorted table, the database designer identifies a **sort** column that determines physical **row order**.
  - optimal for **queries that read data in order of the sort column**.
- **hash table**
  - In a hash table, **rows are assigned to buckets**.
  - Each bucket is a block, once full, another bucket is linked to, evenly distributing rows across blocks.
- **hash table bucket**
  - A bucket is a block or group of blocks containing rows.
  - optimal for inserts and deletes of individual rows.
- **hash key**
  - The hash key is a column or group of columns, usually the primary key.
- **hash function**
  - The hash function computes the bucket containing the row from the hash key.
- **modulo function**
  - The modulo function is a simple hash function with four steps.
- **dynamic hash function**
  - A dynamic hash function automatically allocates more blocks to the table, creates additional buckets, and distributes rows across all buckets. With more buckets, fewer rows are assigned to each bucket and, on average, buckets contain fewer linked blocks.
- **Table clusters / multi-tables**
  - Table clusters, also called multi-tables, interleave rows of two or more tables in the same storage area.
  - optimal when joining interleaved tables on the cluster key, since physical row location is the same as output order.
- **cluster key**
  - Table clusters have a cluster key, a column that is available in all interleaved tables.

## 5.3 Single-level indexes

- **single-level index**
  - A single-level index is a file containing **column values**, along with pointers to rows containing the column value.
  - Indexes are created by database designers with the `CREATE INDEX` command.
  - Single-level indexes are normally sorted on the **column value**.
  - ![single level index](img/single_level_index.PNG)
- **multi-column index**
  - In a multi-column index, each index entry is a composite of values from all indexed columns. In all other respects, multi-column indexes behave exactly like indexes on a single column.
- **table scan**
  - A table scan is a database operation that **reads table blocks directly**, without accessing an index.
  - When a `SELECT` query is executed, the database examines the `WHERE` clause and estimates hit ratio. If hit ratio is high, the database performs a table scan. If hit ratio is low, the query needs only a few table blocks, performs index scan.
  - ![index scan](img/index_scan.PNG)
- **index scan**
  - An index scan is a database operation that **reads index blocks sequentially**, in order to locate the needed table blocks.
  - When a `SELECT` query is executed, the database examines the `WHERE` clause and estimates hit ratio. If hit ratio is high, the database performs a table scan. If hit ratio is low, the query needs only a few table blocks, performs index scan.
  - ![index scan](img/index_scan.PNG)
- **Hit ratio / filter factor / selectivity**
  - Hit ratio, also called filter factor or selectivity, is the **percentage of table rows selected by a query**.
- **binary search**
  - **Index must be sorted!**
  - In a binary search, the database **repeatedly splits the index in two** until it finds the entry containing the search value.
    - The database first compares the search value to an entry in the middle of the index.
    - If the search value is less than the entry value, the search value is in the first half of the index. If not, the search value is in the second half.
- **primary index / clustering index**
  - A primary index, also called a clustering index, is an index on a sort column.
- **secondary index / nonclustering index**
  - A secondary index, also called a nonclustering index, is an index that is not on the sort column.
- **dense index**
  - A dense index contains an **entry for every table row**.
- **sparse index**
  - A sparse index contains an **entry for every table block**.
  - ![sparse index](img/sparse_index.PNG)

## 5.4 Multi-level indexes

- **multi-level index**
  - A multi-level index **stores column values and row pointers in a hierarchy**.
  - Each level above the bottom is a **sparse sorted index to the level below**.
  - The number of index entries per block is called the **fan-out** of a multi-level index.
  - multi-level index is the **most commonly used index type**.
  - ![multi-level index](img/multi-level_index.PNG)
- **fan-out**
  - The number of index entries per block is called the fan-out of a multi-level index.
- **branch**
  - Each path from the top-level block to a bottom-level block is called a branch.
- **balanced / imbalanced**
  - Multi-level indexes are called balanced when all branches are the same length and imbalanced when branches are different lengths.
- **B+tree**
  - B+tree. All indexed values appear in the bottom level. Pointers to table blocks appear only in the bottom level. Since some indexed values also appear in higher levels, values are occasionally repeated in the index.
- **B-tree**
  - B-tree. If an indexed value appears in a higher level, the value is not repeated at lower levels. Instead, a pointer to the corresponding table block appears in the higher level along with the value.

## 5.5 Other indexes

- **Other Multi-Level Indexes**
  - Hash index
  - Bitmap index
  - Logical index
  - Function index
- **hash index**
  - In a hash index, index entries are assigned to buckets.
  - As an index grows, some buckets eventually fill up, and additional blocks are allocated and linked to the initial block.
  - ![hash index](img/hash_index.PNG)
- **bucket**
  - A bucket is a block or group of blocks containing index entries.
- **hash function**
  - The bucket containing each index entry is determined by a hash function, which computes a bucket number from the value of the indexed column.
- **bitmap index**
  - A bitmap index is a grid of bits.
  - Bitmap indexes contain **ones and zeros**.
  - enable fast reads.
  - ![bitmap index](img/bitmap_index.PNG)
- **physical index**
  - A single- or multi-level index normally contains pointers to table blocks and is called a physical index.
- **logical index**
  - A logical index is a single- or multi-level index in which pointers to table blocks are replaced with primary key values.
- **function index**
  - In a function index, the database designer specifies a function on the column value. Index entries contain the result of the function applied to column values, rather than the column values.

## 5.6 Tablespaces and partitions

- **tablespace**
  - A tablespace is a database **object** that **maps** one or more **tables** to a **single file**.
  - not specified in the SQL standard.
  - Database administrators can **manually create tablespaces** and assign one or multiple tables to each tablespace. Database administrators can improve query performance by **assigning frequently accessed tables** to tablespaces stored on **fast storage media**.
  - ![tablespace](img/tablespace.PNG)

```sql
CREATE TABLESPACE TablespaceName
[ ADD DATAFILE 'FileName' ];

CREATE TABLE TableName
( ColumnName ColumnDefintion, ... )
[ TABLESPACE TablespaceName ];
```

- **fragmented**
  - As files are updated, blocks become scattered, or fragmented, across many tracks.
- **partition**
  - A partition is a subset of table data. One table has many partitions that do not overlap and, together, contain all table data.
- **horizontal partition**
  - A horizontal partition is a subset of table rows.
- **vertical partition**
  - A vertical partition is a subset of table columns.
- **shard**
  - Like a partition, a shard is a subset of table data, usually a subset of rows rather than columns. Unlike partitions, which are stored on different storage devices of a single computer, shards are stored on different computers of a distributed database.
- **partition expression / partition columns**
  - To partition a table, the database administrator specifies a partition expression based on one or more partition columns. The partition expression may be simple, such as the value of a single partition column, or a complex expression based on several partition columns. Rows are assigned to partitions in one of the following ways: .
- **range partition**
  - A range partition associates each partition with a range of partition expression values. The VALUES LESS THAN keywords specify the upper bound of each range. The MAXVALUE keyword represents the highest column value, and VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE specifies the highest range. Each partition is explicitly named by the database administrator.
- **list partition**
  - A list partition associates each partition with an explicit list of partition expression values using the VALUES IN keywords. Like a range partition, each partition is explicitly named.
- **hash partition**
  - A hash partition requires a partition expression with positive integer values. The database administrator specifies the number of partitions, N, and partitions are automatically named p0 through p(N-1). The partition number for each row is computed as: (partition expression value) modulo N.
- **key partition**
  - A key partition is similar to a hash partition, except the partition expression is determined automatically by the database.

## 5.7 Physical design

- **Logical design**
  - Logical design specifies **tables, columns, and keys**.
- **Physical design**
  - Physical design specifies **indexes, table structures, and partitions**.
  - Physical design **affects query performance** but **never affects query results**.
- **storage engine / storage manager**
  - A storage engine or storage manager **translates instructions** generated by a query processor into **low-level commands** that access data on storage media.

```sql
-- CREATE
CREATE INDEX IndexName ON TableName (Column1, ..., ColumnN);
-- DROP
DROP INDEX IndexName ON TableName;
-- SHOW
SHOW INDEX FROM TableName;
```

- **CREATE INDEX**
  - The CREATE INDEX statement creates an index by specifying the index name and table columns that compose the index.
- **DROP INDEX**
  - The DROP INDEX statement deletes a table's index.
- **SHOW INDEX**
  - The SHOW INDEX statement displays a table's index.
- **EXPLAIN**
  - The EXPLAIN statement generates a result table that describes how a statement is executed by the storage engine.
- **slow query log**
  - The MySQL slow query log is a file that records all long-running queries submitted to the database.

## 6.1 MySQL architecture

- **Architecture**
  - Architecture describes the components of a computer system and the relationships between components.
- **Tools**
  - Tools interact directly with database users and administrators, and send queries to the query processor.
- **query processor**
  - The query processor manages connections from multiple users and compiles queries into low-level instructions for the storage engine.
- **storage engine / storage manager**
  - The storage engine, also called a storage manager, executes instructions, manages indexes, and interacts with the file system.
- **file system**
  - The file system accesses data on storage media. The file system contains both system and user data, such as log files, tables, and indexes.
- **MySQL Server / MySQL Enterprise Edition**
  - MySQL is available in a free version, called MySQL Server, and a paid version, called MySQL Enterprise Edition.
- **Monitor**
  - Monitor collects and displays information on CPU, memory, and index utilization, as well as queries and results. Database administrators use Enterprise Monitor to manage and tune large databases with many users.
- **Audit**
  - Audit keeps track of all database changes. For each change, Audit tracks the time of change and who made the change. Audit supports government and business audit requirements for sensitive databases such as financial, medical, and defense.
- **Utility programs**
  - Utility programs include approximately 30 tools, grouped in five categories: installation, client, administrative, developer, and miscellaneous tools.
- **connection**
  - A connection is a link between tools and the query processor. Each connection specifies a database name, server address, logon name, and password.
- **execution plan**
  - An execution plan is a detailed, low-level sequence of steps that specify exactly how to process a query.
- **query parser**
  - The query parser checks each query for syntax errors and converts valid queries to an internal representation.
- **query optimizer**
  - The query optimizer reads the internal representation, generates alternative execution plans, estimates execution times, and selects the fastest plan. Estimates are based on heuristics and statistics about data, like the number of rows in each table and the number of values in each column. These statistics are maintained in the data dictionary, described below.
- **cache manager**
  - For optimal performance, the query processor layer has a cache manager that stores reusable information in main memory.
- **buffer manager**
  - To reduce data access time, the buffer manager retains data blocks from the file system for possible reuse.
- **buffer**
  - The data blocks are retained in an area of main memory called the buffer.
- **least recently used / LRU**
  - The InnoDB buffer manager uses a least recently used or LRU algorithm. The LRU algorithm tracks the time each block was last accessed and, when space is needed, discards 'stale' blocks.
- **catalog / data dictionary**
  - A catalog, also known as a data dictionary, is a directory of tables, columns, keys, indexes, and other objects in a relational database.

## 6.2 Cloud databases

- **tiers**
  - Multiple computers linked by a network are often grouped in layers, called tiers, and arranged in a hierarchy.
- **single-tier architecture**
  - Prior to 1990, most software ran in a single-tier architecture, consisting of a personal or corporate computer connected directly to monitors.
- **multi-tier architecture**
  - Since 1990, complex corporate and government applications have increasingly been implemented in a multi-tier architecture:
    - The top tier consists of computers interacting directly with end-users.
    - The bottom tier consists of servers managing resources like databases and email.
    - One or more middle tiers execute a variety of functions, such as user authorization, business logic, and communication with other computers.
- **Web architecture**
  - Web architecture is a multi-tier architecture consisting of web browsers and web servers communicating over the internet:
    - Web browsers, on the top tier, manage user interaction.
    - Web servers, on a middle tier, generate web pages for display on web browsers and transmit user requests to services running on lower tiers.
    - Application servers run application software, process user requests, and communicate with databases and other services.
    - Services, such as database and authentication, comprise the bottom tier.
- **on-premise**
  - Prior to 2000, most commercial software was on-premise, or installed and run on customer computers.
- **cloud services**
  - With cloud services, a vendor such as Amazon, Microsoft, or Google implements computer services on lower tiers of a web architecture. For a fee, cloud services are made available over the internet to customers.

- **shared nothing**
  - In a shared nothing computer, processors share neither memory nor storage media.
- **local area network**
  - A local area network consists of cables extending over a small area, typically within one facility. Local area networks usually use the Ethernet communication protocol.
- **wide area network**
  - A wide area network spans multiple facilities in different geographic locations, separated by many miles. Wide area networks may communicate via cables, satellite, or telephone lines, often using internet communication protocols.
- **node**

  - A parallel database runs on a parallel computer or cluster.
- **distributed database**
  - A distributed database runs on multiple computers connected by a wide area network.
- **distributed transaction**
  - A distributed transaction updates data on multiple nodes of a distributed database. In a distributed transaction, either all nodes or no nodes must be successfully updated.
- **two-phase commit**
  - Databases commonly implement distributed transactions with a technique called two-phase commit. The two-phase commit has four steps:
    1. In phase 1, a central transaction coordinator notifies all participating nodes of the required updates.
    2. Participating nodes receive the notification, store the update in a local log, and send a confirmation message to the transaction coordinator. Participating nodes do not yet commit the update to the database.
    3. Phase 2 begins when the transaction coordinator receives confirmation from all participating nodes. The transaction coordinator now instructs all nodes to commit.
    4. Participating nodes receive the commit message, commit the update to the database, and notify the transaction coordinator of success.
- **local transaction**
  - A local transaction updates data on a single node of a distributed database.
- **synchronous**
  - Updates in a distributed transaction are synchronous, since the updates occur at the same time from the perspective of the database user.
- **asynchronous**
  - Updates in separate local transactions are asynchronous.
- **eventually consistent**
  - Databases that use local rather than distributed transactions are called eventually consistent.
- **consistent**
  - A consistent database conforms to all rules at all times.
- **available**
  - In an available database, 'live' nodes must respond to queries at all times.
- **network partition**
  - A network partition forms when a network error prevents nodes from communicating.
- **partition-tolerant**
  - A partition-tolerant database continues to function when a network partition occurs.
- **CAP theorem**
  - The CAP theorem states that a distributed database cannot simultaneously be Consistent, Available, and Partition-tolerant. A distributed database can guarantee any two, but not all three, of these properties.

## 6.4 Replicated databases

- **replica**
  - A replica is a copy of an entire database, a table, or a subset of table data.
- **replicated database**
  - A replicated database maintains two or more replicas on separate storage devices.
- **storage arrays**
  - Some storage devices, called storage arrays, manage replicas internally, without database intervention.
- **primary/secondary**
  - The primary/secondary technique designates one node as primary. All updates are first applied to the primary node in local transactions. Secondary nodes are updated after the primary node commits, with independent local transactions.
- **group replication**
  - The group replication technique applies updates to any node in a group. Prior to committing, a node broadcasts transaction information to other nodes, which look for conflicts with concurrent transactions. If any node detects a conflict, an algorithm determines which transaction commits and which rolls back.
- **central catalog**
  - In a central catalog, the entire catalog resides on a single node.
- **replicated catalog**
  - In a replicated catalog, a copy of the catalog resides on each node.

## 6.5 Data warehouses

- **operational data**
  - Organizations use operational data to conduct daily business functions.
- **analytic data**
  - Organizations use analytic data to understand, manage, and plan the business.
- **reporting data / decision support data**
  - Analytic data is sometimes called reporting data or decision support data.
- **data warehouse**
  - A data warehouse is a separate database optimized for analytics rather than operations.
- **data mart**
  - A data mart is a data warehouse designed for a specific business area, such as sales, human resources, or product development.
- **extract-transform-load / ETL**
  - The five-step process is commonly referred to as the extract-transform-load, or ETL, process.
- **ETL tools**
  - Since the ETL process is time-consuming and difficult to automate, many organizations use special software products, called ETL tools, to minimize programming.

## 6.6 Data warehouse design

- **dimensional design / star schema**
  - A dimensional design, also called a star schema, consists of fact and dimension tables: .
- **fact table**
  - A fact table contains numeric data used to measure business performance, such as sales revenue or number of employees. Each row in a fact table consists of numeric fact columns and foreign keys that reference dimension tables.
- **dimension table**
  - A dimension table contains textual data that describes the fact data, such as product line, organizational unit, and geographical region.
- **dimension hierarchy**
  - A dimension hierarchy is a sequence of columns in which each column has a one-many relationship to the next column.
- **date dimension**
  - Each row of the date dimension table corresponds to a day. If an organization tracks data for 100 years, the date dimension contains 36,500 rows (100 years × 365 days per year).
- **time dimension**
  - Each row of the time dimension table corresponds to a minute of the day. The time dimension contains 1,440 rows (24 hours × 60 minutes per hour).
- **type 2 design for slowly changing dimensions**
  - Adding start and end foreign keys to the fact table is called type 2 design for slowly changing dimensions.

  - The MySQL software library libmysqld configures MySQL as an embedded database but was discontinued as of MySQL release 8.0.
- **federated database**
  - A federated database is a collection of two or more participating databases underneath a coordinating software layer. The participating databases are autonomous and heterogeneous: .
- **autonomous database**
  - An autonomous database operates independently of other participating databases. An autonomous database is administered and can be queried as if the database were not part of a federated database.
- **Heterogeneous databases**
  - Heterogeneous databases either run under different database systems or have incompatible schema.
- **middleware**
  - The coordinating software layer is called middleware, since the software lies between application programs and database software.
- **global catalog**
  - A global catalog is a directory of participating database objects, such as tables, columns, and indexes.
- **database wrapper**
  - A database wrapper converts the decomposed queries to the appropriate syntax for each participating database.
