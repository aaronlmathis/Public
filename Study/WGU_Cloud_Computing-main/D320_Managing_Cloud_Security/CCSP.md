  - I hate reading course material. I just do. I end up zoning out. Quizlet on 'Learning' mode is my bread and butter. I'll watch videos on concepts I need clarification on, but I rely almost entirely on Quizlet. Though the Quizlet set created by Brian MacFarlane is long, it has questions from the exams in it verbatim. I firmly believe that if you review the 4 sets below, you'll be ready for the exam.
