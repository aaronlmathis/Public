- **WGU Chatter**
  - **Spencer G**: heavy focus on security so know your encryption types (at Rest, In Transit, Client\Server.) Know KMS and CloudHSM. Know your IAM policies and review policies in general. Also understand your Databases - Aurora, DynamoDB, RDBMS. Know your EFS, FSx, EBS, S3 + lifecycles. Try to look for keywords like "Serverless". Exam Dojo and Udemy can be used but I feel like they're harder than the OA since they involve connecting 2-3 services together while the OA is mainly just 1 service at a time but with more depth on that specific service. I used the Course Material Section review questions and Percipio Testprep as the bulk of study for my practice questions.
  - **JW M**: knowing S3 and its Lifecycle policies, what CloudHSM is, The different VPC Endpoints and what each one does, CloudFront, and how Aurora and NoSQL are DIFFERENT from other databases.
  - **Denise W**: heavy on encryption and the differences between Relational vs Non-relational databases.

  - ?

## Best Practices

- **Automate your environment**
  - dynamic increase/decrease infrastructure.
  - automate monitoring/notifying when resources change.
- **Avoid single points of failure**
  - create secondary systems to avoid single point failure.
  - ![single point failure](img/single-point-failure.PNG)
- **Choose the right database solutions**
  - acceptable latency, max concurrent users, data integrity.
- **Design services, not servers**
  - use AWS services to connect your infrastructure.
  - containers(docker), ephemeral(IaC), Queues handle communication between applications.
  - static assets stored in S3.
- **Enable Scalability**
  - dynamic scale based on load. increase availability.
- **Optimize for cost**
  - CapEx: capital expense. One-time investments in long-term assets. (e.g. hardware servers)
  - OpEx: operational expense. Ongoing costs associated with running the project. (e.g. software license, pay-as-you-go).
- **Secure your entire infrastructure**
  - encrypt data transit and rest.
  - network isolation.
  - least privilege access. MFA.
  - traceability(log every change, access).
  - IaC. automation ensures consistent security.
- **Treat resources as disposable**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC). declarative control infrastructure.
  - terminate resources not in use.
- **Use loosely-coupled components**
  - avoid tightly-coupled resources.
  - ![loosely-coupled components](img/loosely-coupled.PNG)
- **Use Caching**
  - request are faster, increase data throughput.
  - ![caching](img/caching.PNG)

## Authentication, Authorization and Security

- **ABAC**
  - Attribute-Based Access Control. If both principal(user, group, role) have same tag as resource, policy is applied.
  - combine with **Tagging** to define permissions.
  - **Create ABAC**
    1. create identities(user, roles). Tag with labels.
    2. tag new resources. create policy that new resources must have certain tags. (e.g. 'project' tag and 'team' tag).
    3. configure permissions.
  - ![abac](img/abac.PNG)
- **Access Control List (ACL)**
  - stateless firewall. scoped at the **subnet level**.
  - **allow inbound/outbound traffic** by default.
  - **ACL**: one-to-many subnets.
  - **subnet**: one-to-one ACL.
  - ![ACL](img/acl.PNG)
  - ![ACL chain](img/acl2.PNG)
  - **Custom ACL**
    - default **deny in/outbound traffic**.
- **Bastion Hosts**
  - public entrypoint. typically firewalled, out to private network.
  - minimize entry points.
  - bastion security group must add **allow in** from **internet**.
  - private subnet security group must **allow in** from **bastion**.
  - ![bastion hosts](img/bastion.PNG)
- **Cloud Trail (AWS)**
  - log and monitor activity. default **90-day** history. who, what, when, where.
- **IAM**
  - Identity and Access Management. Authentication(prove identity) and Authorization(**permissions**(CRUD)).
  - supports **Active Directory** and standard identity providers.
  - fine-grained access
  - **root user**: full access. **avoid using for common task**. enable **MFA**. least privilege.
  - IAM Federation -> combine existing user accounts with AWS, uses SAML, Active Directory.
  - ![iam](img/iam.PNG)
- **IAM Group**
  - users granted identical authorization.
- **IAM Policy**:
  - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsidentityandaccessmanagementiam.html>
  - list of defined permissions. **JSON** format. **principle of least privilege**.
  - default **deny**. **allow** must be **explicit** or **everything denied**.
  - explicit deny **overrides allow**.
  - ![IAM flow](img/iam_flow.PNG)
  - **Identity-Based**: attach to IAM principal(user, group, role).
    - **AWS managed**: standalone, administered by AWS.
    - **Customer managed**: standalone, administered by you.
      - Suggested to use managed policies, not inline, to view all policies in the console.
    - **Inline**: embedded in an IAM identity (user/group/role), exists only on IAM identity.
  - **Resource-Based**: attach to AWS resource. **always inline**. **no managed** policies. (e.g. S3 bucket).
  - ![iam policy](img/iam_policy.PNG)
  - ![iam policy json](img/iam_json.PNG)
  - **ARNs**
    - Amazon Resource Name. identifies resources.
    - Syntax: `arn:partition:service:region:account:resource`
    - (e.g. `arn:aws:iam::123456:user/mmajor`)
  - **Wildcards**: `*` include all. (e.g. `s3:*`, `iam:*AccessKey*`)
- **IAM Role**
  - grant **temporary** access.
  - **assumable** by a **person, application, or service**.
  - you must be **granted permission to switch to the role**.
  - **AWS STS**
    - Security Token Service. enables request of **temporary limited-privilege credentials**.
    - cross account or **federated** access.
- **IAM User**
  - authentication, assumed programmatically, credentials do expire.
  - IAM user is **person** or **application** that must make **API calls** to AWS products.
  - Each user **must have a unique name** (with no spaces in the name).
- **Identity Federation**
  - user is authenticated by system external to the AWS account.
  - allow access without having to create IAM users.
  - ![sts idp](img/sts_idp.PNG)
  - **Identity Federation: Three Options**
    1. **AWS STS**: Security Token Service. enables request of **temporary limited-privilege credentials**.
       1. **identity service providers (IdPs)**: Microsoft Active Directory, or custom identity broker.
       2. ![sts idps](img/sts_idps.PNG)
    2. **SAML**: security assertion markup language.
       1. ![sts saml](img/sts_saml.PNG)
    3. **Amazon Cognito**: web identity provider.
       1. fully managed, **authentication**, **authorization**, and **user management** for **web** and **mobile** apps.
       2. creates **user pools** and **identity pools**.
       3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: open source identity management. (e.g. Facebook, Google or SAML auth).
       4. ![sts cognito](img/sts_cognito.PNG)
- **Organizations (AWS)**
  - large organizations typically isolate business departments with multiple accounts.
  - AWS Organizations centralize management, consolidate billing, and enforce policies across multiple AWS accounts.
  - **SCPs**: service control policies. create top level policy that cannot be overridden.
    - **explicit allow** or it's denied.
    - **cannot** be **overridden** by local AWS **account admins**.
  - ![organizations](img/organizations.PNG)
- **RBAC**
  - Role Based Access Control. you create admin role, developer role... then assign them to user. time consuming.
- **Security Groups**
  - **Stateful Firewalls**: instance level. policy with **allow/deny rules** to ports and IPv4/IPv6.
  - stand alone policy and can be **attached** to **multiple instances** or **combined** with **other security groups**.
  - **default** inbound:block, outbound:allow.
  - **Scope**: region/VPC.
  - **Errors**
    - **Timeout**: blocked by security group.
    - **Connection Refused**: application error. traffic went through to EC2, but EC2 did not respond.
- **Root User**
  - highest level of privileges. Only one with **default** access to billing information.
  - best practice to not use root.
- **Tagging**
  - use tagging to label users. **50** tags per resource.
  - key = value.

## Automation

- **Automation**
  - **without** automation it is a long **manual process** to build architecture.
  - ![automation tool](img/automation_tool.PNG)
- **CloudFormation (AWS)**
  - IaC. simplify infrastructure management. **model, create,** and **manage AWS resources** .
  - **Stack**: YAML or JSON format. creates a 'stack'(becomes the running environment).
    - **Update Stack**: update change to template.

    - **Detect Drift**: detects modified infrastructure outside the CloudFormation template.
  - **Version control**: when uploaded to S3, Github, or AWS CodeCommit.
  - **AWS CloudFormation Designer**: GUI drag-n-drop design tool.
  - ![cloudformation template example](img/cloudFormation_template.PNG)
  - ![cloudformation template example 2](img/cloudFormation_template2.PNG)
  - **Change Set**: preview changes **before** implementing them.
  - ![cloudFormation change set](img/change_set.PNG)
  - **Scope**: **Region** scoped.
  - Organize templates the same you would a website: frontend, backend, network, security...

  - **CloudFormation and OpWorks** compliment each other.
  - ![CloudFormation and OpWorks](img/cloudFormation_Opworks.PNG)
- **Systems Manager (AWS)**
  - AWS version of **Ansible**. for managing massive scale of instances. updates/patches. on-prem/cloud.
  - **SSM Agent**: install on **EC2** instance or **on-prem** computer.
    - data is sent back to Systems Manager.
    - Run commands, update/patch **remotely** without needing a Bastion Host.
  - ![ssm agent](img/ssm_agent.PNG)

## Caching

- **Caching**
  - **high speed data storage layer**.
  - distance from **origin server** to client induces latency.
  - improve performance(high **throughput**) of data retrieval and reduce **latency**. using edge locations.
  - **Best Practice**
    - data that requires **slow, expensive query**.
    - **frequent** request for **static data** that can be **stale** for some time.
  - ![caching 2](img/caching2.PNG)
- **CloudFront**
  - **Content Delivery Network**: globally distributed system of caching servers.
  - AWS CDN(content delivery network) edge network. supports **websockets** and **HTTPS**.
  - **AWS Shield Standard**: extra layer of security(DDOS). resilient. -no extra cost.
  - **AWS Certificate Manager**: create/manage **SSL** certs. -no extra cost.
  - **Resilient**: DDOS protection and DNS Route 53(distribute across Edge locations).
  - over 200 points-of-presence (PoP), edge locations and **edge caches**. (e.g. share S3 assets all over the world).
  - ![cloudFront](img/cloud_front.PNG)
  - **Setup**: specify **origin server**, configure **distribution**.
  - ![cloudFront start](img/cloud_front_start.PNG)
  - **Edge Cache**: sometimes called **PoP (point of presence)**. **frequent** content, **close** to your users.
  - **Regional Edge Cache**: larger cache so **longer shelf life**. **origin** to Edge Caches.
  - **Expire Content**
    - **TTL**: time-to-live. specify length of time.
    - **Change Object Name**: use versions.
    - **Invalidate Objects**: not recommended. you force delete objects from CDN.
- **Caching Databases**
  - reduce cost, latency, volume of DB reads.
  - **Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**: extremely performant(microsecond-scale response time).
    - adds in-memory acceleration.
  - ![DAX](img/dax.PNG)
  - **Remote or Side Cache**: adjacent to database.
    - key:value NoSQL in-memory store. typically for Redis or Memcached. read-heavy workloads.
  - ![side cache](img/side_cache.PNG)

    - supports **engines**: Memcached(**20** cache nodes, horizontal scale, no multiple AZs) and Redis(**250** cache nodes, complex memory types).
    - **node**: smallest block of **network-attached RAM**. each node is independent, has own **DNS name** and **port**.
    - **cluster**: logical group of nodes.
    - **Scope**: region. multiple AZs.
    - **Lazy Load**: app request Elasticache data. If not exist, app ask database. app writes data to Elasticache.
      - advantages: only requested data is cached. **stale data**.
    - **Write-through**: data is written to database and Elasticache. **real-time data updates**.
    - **TTL**: stale data is updated when TTL expires.
  - ![elasticache](img/elasticache.PNG)
  - ![elasticache cluster](img/elasticache_cluster.PNG)
- **Caching Web Sessions**
  - **sessions**: manage user **authentication** and store **data** while user interacts with application.
  - **Sticky Sessions**: ELB uses cookies to route traffic to instance with session.
    - by default an ELB will route to smallest load, but with sticky sessions, ELB routes to same instance.
    - if instance fails, session is lost.
    - prevents ELB from truly balancing the load.
  - **Distributed Cache**: store session data in cache. solves single-point-failure and load balancing sessions.
    - can also use **DynamoDB** to persist sessions.
  - ![distrubted cache](img/distributed_cache.PNG)
  - ![distrubted cache dynamoDB](img/distributed_cache_dynamoDB.PNG)

      - **HVM**: hardware virtual machine. best performance.
    - you can only stop/start **EBS** backed AMI.
    - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)

    - ![ec2 instance type](img/ec2_instance_type.PNG)
  - **EC2 Placement Groups**
    - control Availability Zone where instances run. logical grouping to create **low latency** between running **instances**.
    - instance can launched in only one placement group. **dedicated host** **cannot** run in placement group.
    - **Cluster**: lowest-latency and high packet-per-second network. **same server rack**.
    - **Partition**: low-latency with reduced correlated hardware failure risk. **same or different server racks**.
      - good for low-latency with large volume of instances.
    - **Spread**: low-latency. at least one instance is in **another Availability Zone**.
  - **EC2 Storage**
    - **instance store**. default. create with EC2. ephemeral storage. **cannot stop, only terminate**. (e.g. buffers, cache, scratch data).
    - **EBS**: elastic block store. **persistent** block-storage volumes. **root volume**
      - **single instance** only. can be detached and **moved** to **any single instance** in same **Availability Zone**.
      - **EC2 with EBS** can be placed in **hibernation** and shutdown. preserves **RAM memory**.
      - **EBS Optimized**: dedicated network, higher I/O.
      - ![EBS optimized](img/ebs_optimized.PNG)
    - **EFS**: elastic file system. **data volume** that serves **multiple Linux instances**. **NFS** protocol.

    - use **DNS** mapped to random IP's.
  - **EC2 Tiers**
    - **per-second billing**: only on **Linux/Ubuntu**. others per-hour.
    - **On-Demand**: short, unpredictable workload.
    - **Reserved**: 1 - 3 year commitment. **EC2 only**.
    - **Savings Plan**: same discounts as Reserved. 1 - 3 year commitment.
      - flexible: **EC2, Fargate, Lambda, instance family, size, OS, tenancy, region**.
    - **Spot Instance**: cheapest. for short ephemeral workloads. risk of losing the instance while running.
    - **Dedicated Hosts**: physical servers(hardware) dedicated to you. single tenancy.
    - **Best Practice**: use **combination** reserved, savings-plan, on-demand, spot to save money.
    - ![EC2 Tier best practices](img/ec2_tiers.PNG)
    - ![EC2 savings plan vs reserved](img/ec2_savings_plan_vs_reserved.PNG)
  - **EC2 User Data**
    - script run as **root** only once during the **initial EC2 instance start**.
    - **Instance Metadata URL**: must run from inside instance.
    - **Baking**: custom AMI(decrease boot time) <--> just enough AMI(decrease build time).
    - ![user data](img/user_data.PNG)
    - ![instance metadata](img/user_data_metadata.PNG)
    - ![fully baked vs just enough AMI](img/full_baked_vs_just_enough_ami.PNG)

## Geography, Region, Availability Zone

- **Cloud Architecture**
  - applying cloud-based technology to meet technical and business requirements.
- **Region**
  - Geographical location with **two or more availability zones**. (e.g us-east-1, eu-west-1).
  - Most services provided by AWS are **region scoped**. (e.g. data for a service used in one region is not replicated in another region).
  - China and GovCloud regions have restricted access.
  - **Best Practices**
    - use region with lowest latency to end users.
    - complies with local government law. (e.g. where data is stored, who can access data center...).
- **Availability Zone (AZ)**
  - **one or more data centers** in same Region, separated from each other with redundant power, and networking.
  - networked together through the **AWS backbone network**.
  - **Best Practice**
    - choose AZ that protects against natural disasters.
    - latency reduction for end user.
  - ![availability zone](img/availability_zone.PNG)
- **AWS Local Zone**
  - extension of Region that is closer to end user(edge).
  - compute, storage, database **closer to large populations** where **no Region exist**. (e.g. Los Angeles Local Zone).
- **Data Centers**
  - location of physical servers. redundant hardware, power, cooling, and networking.
  - networked to other data centers through the **AWS backbone network**.

## Messaging

- **Coupled Architecture**
  - tightly coupled architecture is difficult to scale.
  - ![decoupling](img/decoupled.PNG)
  - **loose coupling**: ELB external and internal can loose couple architecture.
  - ![loose coupling](img/loose_coupling.PNG)
- **SQS**
  - **Simple Queue Service**. temporary repository(default **4** days) for messages waiting to be processed. encrypted.
    - buffer between producer and consumer.
    - max message size: **256 kb**.
  - **Producer**: sender of message.
  - **Consumer**: recipient of message. polls for new message. processes and deletes message during visibility timeout.
  - **Long polling**: SQS queries all servers for messages, then sends back all messages in single request.
  - **Visibility Timeout**: default **30 seconds**. period of time no other consumer can 'see' message. allows time for message to be processed and deleted from Queue.
  - **Scope**: region. multiple AZs.

  - (e.g EC2 state change(running -> stopped), Auto Scaling change, EBS volume creation...).
  - **Rules**: JSON. route events to targets.
  - **Targets**: process events.
  - ![eventBridge](img/eventBridge.PNG)

## Network

- **Cloud Watch**
  - **monitor** infrastructure and **automate** scaling.
- **Elastic IP**
  - fixed IPv4 address. map to **instance** or elastic network **interface**.
- **Direct Connect (DX)**
  - dedicated **private** network connection. **consistent performance**. (e.g. use on-prem database with AWS).
  - access any VPC or AWS service in **any Region** from any supported **DX location**.
  - 802.1q VLANs '_dot1q_'. encapsulation and tagging for VLAN over Ethernet.
  - ![direct connect](img/direct_connect.PNG)
  - **High Availability**
    - highly available with redundant DX connections.
  - ![direct connect high availability](img/direct_connect_high_availability.PNG)
    - high resilient, fault tolerant architecture. multiple datacenters.
  - ![direct connect high durability](img/direct_connect_high_durability.PNG)
- **Endpoint (VPC)**
  - **private** communication between VPN and **AWS services**. uses **AWS backbone**. no other infrastructure needed.
  - only returns traffic that originated from your VPC endpoint.
  - **Interface Endpoint**: powered by **AWS PrivateLink**. Load Balancer, CloudWatch... creates a network interface.
  - **Gateway Endpoint**: connection to **S3** or **DynamoDB**.
  - ![endpoint](img/endpoint.PNG)
- **Internet Gateway (Virtual Private Gateway)**
  - internet communication to VPC resources.
- **Multi-VPC and Multi-Accounts**
  - are **most** VPC use cases. max **5 VPC** per Region.
  - **Multi-VPC**
    - **single team/organization**. **Governance** and **compliance standards** might require greater isolation.
  - ![multi-vpc](img/multi-vpc.PNG)
  - **Multi-account**
    - **enterprise or large organizations** or **multiple IT teams**. **medium-sized**, anticipate rapid growth.
  - ![multi-account](img/multi-account.PNG)
- **NAT Gateway**
  - enable **private subnets outbound communication** with Internet Gateway. **no inbound request**.
  - must be placed in **public subnet**.
  - requires an **Elastic IP**. `0.0.0.0/0` is gateway to internet.
  - ![nat gateway](img/nat_gateway.PNG)
  - ![nat gateway routing](img/nat_gateway_routing.PNG)
- **Peering (VPC)**
  - **one-to-one** network connection between **two VPCs**. no other infrastructure needed.
  - traffic stays on AWS backbone. no bottlenecks or single point of failure.
  - **Route**: each peered VPC must add route to route table, ACL and Security Groups updated.
    - **No overlap in CIDR**.
    - not transitive(A <-> B, A <-> C, B and C cannot communicate with each other).
      - to connect all VPCs requires **full-mesh network**. `n*(n-1)` (e.g. 6 VPCs fully connected = 30 connections).
    - only one active VPC peering between VPCs. (e.g. A <-> B, another redundant peering A <-> B not allowed).
  - ![peering route](img/peering.PNG)
  - **Scope**: any AWS VPC. in another **VPC account**, or **Region**(Inter-Region VPC peering).
  - **Best Practices**
    - isolate workloads with different VPCs. peer them to transfer data.
- **Route Table**
  - **control** traffic from subnet or gateway. can create **custom** route table.
  - all **subnets** must be associated with a route table.
  - **route table**: one-to-many. can have **multiple subnets**.
  - **subnet**: one-to-one. can have only **one route table**.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**
  - connect on-prem to VPC. **IPSec encryption**. creates **two**(default) or **more** encrypted 'tunnels' between networks.
  - charged per connection-hour.
  - **Static Routing**: if Gateway device does not support 'Dynamic', you must manually update route table.
  - **Dynamic Routing**: BGP(border gateway protocol) dynamically finds route.
  - ![vpn site-to-site](img/vpn_site-to-site.PNG)
- **Subnet**
  - segment of VPC ip address range. **not isolation boundaries**.
  - **subset** of CIDR(classless inter domain routing, `/28`) block. **cannot overlap**
  - subnet **mapped** to **one Availability Zone**.
  - AWS **reserves five (first four, then last ip) ip addresses** in each subnet.
  - ![subnet CIDR](img/subnet_cidr.PNG)
  - **Private Subnet**
    - no internet access(unless you have a NAT Gateway). internal VPC access.
    - for outbound only internet access: NAT gateway and Elastic IP is required.
    - route table entry `0.0.0.0/0` with `nat-gq-id` is the gateway to internet.
  - **Public Subnet**
    - connect resources to internet.
    - ![public subnet](img/public_subnet.PNG)
- **Transit Gateway (AWS)**
  - avoid large scale peering. simplify with Transit Gateway. **hub-and-spoke model**.
  - connect multiple **VPCs** and **on-prem** with **single gateway**.
  - ![transit gateway](img/transit_gateway.PNG)
  - **Routes**: the Transit Gateway route table enables VPC connection or external.
    - each VPC must have a route to Transit Gateway in it's route table.
    - Transit Gateway must have routes to each VPC to enable VPC-to-VPC communication.
  - ![transit gateway route isolation](img/transit_gateway_route_isolation1.PNG)
- **VPC**
  - virtual private cloud. **logically isolated section** of AWS Cloud for the **virtual network that you define**.
  - ![vpc flow](img/vpc_flow.PNG)
  - **Scope**: **single region**.
    - spans **all AZs** in a Region. can host supported resources from any **Availability Zone** within it's Region.
  - **Best Practices**
    - **one subnet per AZ** for **each group of hosts** with unique routing requirements.
    - **divide VPC network range evenly** across all AZs in a Region.
    - **reserve extra address space** for future use. CIDR, VPC size.
    - **VPC CIDR range cannot overlap** other ranges.
