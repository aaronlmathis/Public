  - analyze how the change will effect the project’s constraints: **scope, cost and time**.
  - PM will create an information package outlining the change request, schedule changes, scope changes, risks, resource requirements, and notable impacts.
  - PM will document change recommendations directly in the **change log**.
- **Decide on an outcome**
  - identify and get sign-off from the decision makers(authority to make change).
    - Operational Change: little impact. Normal day-to-day business. PM, functional manager, or CCB.
    - Strategic Change: effects all aspects of business. project sponsor, CCB, and PMO.

  3. Assign Resources. RACI matrix. Which resources are responsible for which tasks.

## Quality Assurance

- **Quality Assurance**
  - ensuring that project deliverables meet defined standards and requirements.
  - QA plan is created during planning phase and refined throughout the project.
  - QA is a **proactive, preventative** approach, focusing on identifying and preventing potential defects **throughout the project lifecycle** not just testing after development.
  - Quality Control is always monitoring and it's meant to be a "course correction" to the project if things are veering off task.
  - QA activities are **independent of project teams** and often performed by a dedicated QA team or external auditors.
- **Quality Assurance: Verification, Validation, Lessons Learned, Inspection, Audit**

## Software Development Lifecycle SDLC

- **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**
  - produce high-quality, low-cost, thoroughly tested software.
- **SDLC 7 phases**
  1. Planning: outline project scope and purpose.
  2. Requirements: define resources needed and software purpose.
  3. Design & Prototyping: specifications of software: language, security, interface.
  4. Development: write code.
  5. Testing: software compatibility and performs as expected.
  6. Deployment: deploy to production environment.
  7. Operations and Maintenance: support software.
- **SDLC Waterfall Model**
  - sequential model, good for short task or well defined, no change projects.
- **SDLC Iterative Model**
  - hybrid. combines iterative with sequential models.
- **SDLC Spiral Model**
  - risk-centric iterative model.
  - most complex and resource-intensive model. Projects can 'spiral' out of control with cost and scope.

  - helps with fast time-to-market projects.
- **SDLC Strengths**
  - comprehensive framework.
- **SDLC Weaknesses**
  - project success depends on time spent on advanced planning.

## System Development Life Cycle SDLC

- SDLC
  - classic way of looking at system and development.
  - planning -> analysis -> design -> implementation -> maintenance.

## Waterfall

- **Waterfall**
  - follows linear sequence. Work only flows one way. Teams any size.
  - documentation heavy. Steps known in advance. Scope and deliverables defined in advance.
  - Regular on/off boarding(highly specialized members flow in and out of project as needed).
  - Resources are typically fixed(backend, get python developer).
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks work into smaller units.
- **Waterfall 6 phases**
  1. requirements: project requirements.
  2. design: actionable specifications.
  3. implementation: do work.
  4. testing: verify.
  5. delivery: deploy to customer.
  6. maintenance: customer support.
- **Waterfall Communication: Stakeholder, Customer, Changes**
  - Stakeholder: provides comprehensive requirements at start, then review finished product.
  - Customer: customer does not communicate with developer.
  - Communication Changes: very few changes.
- **Waterfall Requirements**
  - requirements dictate how the project looks and behaves.
  - requirements must all be stated at start of project.
  - Collection of Requirements -> Product Creation -> Customer Review -> Maintenance Phase(fix after customer review).
- **Waterfall Budget and Schedule**
  - Budget: fixed, strict, predictable. Good for 'limited' budget.
  - Schedule: predictable. Entire project is planned in advance.
- **Waterfall Environmental Factors: Culture, Development Processes, Industry Standards**
  - Culture: favors vast knowledge and role specialization.
  - Development Processes: customer receives finished product.
  - Industry Standards: linear and sequential. Heavy documentation.
- **Waterfall Use**
  - when you have clear objectives, heavy documentation, and high change cost.

## Work Breakdown Structure

- **WBS**
  - waterfall way of breaking down large projects into deliverables.
  - find the Business **WHAT** not the 'how'. What do we need?
  - find Functional Requirements: what does the project need to do?
  - find Non-Functional Requirements: color, size...
  - project charter -> scope statement -> business,functional,non-functional -> WBS.
  - **Purpose**:
    - The structure helps identify all necessary tasks and ensures no crucial work is missed.
    - It facilitates work estimation and resource allocation based on the size and complexity of each unit.
    - each level of the WBS clarifies the work required at that level.
    - lower levels provide more detail and granularity on how the higher-level work will be accomplished.
  - **Creation Process**:
    - Determine Scope: review Statement of Work (SOW), Business 'WHAT', Function/Non-Functional requirements.
    - Each WBS Level: brief description, resources, cost, time.
    - Level: main label. Top level of section.
    - Element: each sub-section. The label.
    - Leg: group of elements with a shared ancestor.
    - Work Package: where cost and time can be calculated. element without a child element.
    - ![wbs labels](img/wbs3.jpg)
    - Identify deliverables, team members, resources.
      - WBS Level 2: Main catagories. Breaks down the project into major deliverables or phases.
      - WBS Level 3: Further breaks down each deliverable/phase into smaller sub-deliverables/sub-phases.
      - WBS Level 4 on onward: breaking down units of work until you reach the level of **Work Packages**.
  - ![wbs2](img/wbs2.jpg)
- **Creating the Work Package**
  - work package (WP): requirements are decomposed until time and money can be accurately estimated.
  - decomposing. Breaking each requirement into smaller and smaller manageable pieces.
- **WBS vs Backlog**
  - WBS assumes that scope, time, and cost are fixed and works to control them.
  - WBS has more structure than a backlog in its design. The WBS has specific numbering conventions and design rules, including MECE and the 100% rule.

|                         | WBS               | Project Backlog             | Product Backlog              |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Duration                | Length of project | Length of project           | As long as product is viable |
| Scope                   | Fixed             | Flexible                    | Flexible                     |
| Resources               | Fixed             | Fixed                       | Fixed                        |

| Deliverable or Activity | Deliverable       | Deliverable                 | Deliverable                  |
| Hierarchy               | Numbered Levels   | Epic > Feature > User Story | Epic > Feature > User Story  |
| When Created            | Planning Phase    | All Phases                  | Entire Life Cycle            |

- **WBS Dictionary, Work Package, Task**
  - Dictionary: itemized list with id number. Includes more information about item.
    - ![wbs](img/wbs2.jpg)
    - ![wbs dictionary](img/Work-Breakdown-Structure-Dictionary.webp)
  - Work Package: one or more deliverables that need to be created together.
    - collectively develop deliverable.
  - Task: many little activities to create the project.
- **WBS MECE**
  - Mutually Exclusive: no overlaps. each label no repeated.
  - Collectively Exhaustive: Together, all work packages encompass the entire project.
- **WBS Rules**
  - can estimate cost, time, resources.
  - 8/80. Element should last at least 8hrs but no more than 80hrs.
  - will fit in reporting period(report on project status).
  - produces measurable deliverable.
  - breaking down further wouldn't help project.
