## 1.1 Describe cloud computing

- **Define cloud computing**
  - on-demand network access to a shared pool that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort.
  - Microsoft: delivery of computing services over the internet. IoT, AI, ML,
- **Describe the shared responsibility model**
  - customer responsibility vs CSP(Cloud Service Provider).
  - Cloud infrastructure is more secure because company can shift focus on security and not on maintaining hardware.
  - ![shared responsibility model](img/shared-responsibility-model.png)
- **Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid. Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model**
  - **cloud models**: cost-effective, global, secure, scalable, elastic(dynamic scaling), always current(do not have to worry about infrastructure, software patches, upgrades or other IT management task.)
  - **Public**: shared hardware between clients. scalability, agility, PAYG(pay-as-you-go), no maintenance, low skill(to get started).
  - **Private**: your responsible for entire stack. legacy support, control, compliance.
  - **Hybrid**: blend on-prem and Cloud. flexibility.
  - **Community**: infrastructure shared between multiple organizations with common needs.
  - ![microsoft cloud model](img/microsoft_cloud_model.PNG)
- **Describe Economies of Scale**
  - cloud provider purchase large quantities of hardware at discount and pass on savings.
- **CapEx to OpEx**
  - CapEx is hard assets(IT equipment). Spending upfront.
  - OpEx is operating expenses(monthly subscription). PAYG.
  - Cloud **increases** OpEx and **reduces** CapEx.
