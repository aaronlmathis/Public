# AWS Solution Architect Associate (SAA-C03)

## Tips

- **WGU Chatter**
  - **Spencer G**: heavy focus on security so know your encryption types (at Rest, In Transit, Client\Server.) Know KMS and CloudHSM. Know your IAM policies and review policies in general. Also understand your Databases - Aurora, DynamoDB, RDBMS. Know your EFS, FSx, EBS, S3 + lifecycles. Try to look for keywords like "Serverless". Exam Dojo and Udemy can be used but I feel like they're harder than the OA since they involve connecting 2-3 services together while the OA is mainly just 1 service at a time but with more depth on that specific service. I used the Course Material Section review questions and Percipio Testprep as the bulk of study for my practice questions.
  - **JW M**: knowing S3 and its Lifecycle policies, what CloudHSM is, The different VPC Endpoints and what each one does, CloudFront, and how Aurora and NoSQL are DIFFERENT from other databases.
  - **Denise W**: heavy on encryption and the differences between Relational vs Non-relational databases.

## Best Practices

- <a href="#Table-of-Contents">Table of Contents</a>
- **Automate your environment**
  - dynamic increase/decrease infrastructure.
  - automate monitoring/notifying when resources change.
- **Avoid single points of failure**
  - create secondary systems to avoid single point failure.
  - ![single point failure](img/single-point-failure.PNG)
- **Choose the right database solutions**
  - acceptable latency, max concurrent users, data integrity.
- **Design services, not servers**
  - use AWS services to connect your infrastructure.
  - containers(docker), ephemeral(IaC), Queues handle communication between applications.
  - static assets stored in S3.
- **Enable Scalability**
  - dynamic scale based on load. increase availability.
- **Optimize for cost**
  - CapEx: capital expense. One-time investments in long-term assets. (e.g. hardware servers)
  - OpEx: operational expense. Ongoing costs associated with running the project. (e.g. software license, pay-as-you-go).
- **Secure your entire infrastructure**
  - encrypt data transit and rest.
  - network isolation.
  - least privilege access. MFA.
  - traceability(log every change, access).
  - IaC. automation ensures consistent security.
- **Treat resources as disposable**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC). declarative control infrastructure.
  - terminate resources not in use.
- **Use loosely-coupled components**
  - avoid tightly-coupled resources.
  - ![loosely-coupled components](img/loosely-coupled.PNG)
- **Use Caching**
  - request are faster, increase data throughput.
  - ![caching](img/caching.PNG)

## Authentication, Authorization and Security

- <a href="#Table-of-Contents">Table of Contents</a>
- **ABAC**
  - Attribute-Based Access Control. If both principal(user, group, role) have same tag as resource, policy is applied.
  - combine with **Tagging** to define permissions.
  - **Create ABAC**
    1. create identities(user, roles). Tag with labels.
    2. tag new resources. create policy that new resources must have certain tags. (e.g. 'project' tag and 'team' tag).
    3. configure permissions.
  - ![abac](img/abac.PNG)
- **Network Access Control List (ACL)**
  - stateless firewall. scoped at the **subnet level**.
  - **allow inbound/outbound traffic** by default.
  - **Network ACL**: one-to-many subnets.
  - **subnet**: one-to-one Network ACL.
  - ![Network ACL](img/acl.PNG)
  - ![Network ACL chain](img/acl2.PNG)
  - **Custom Network ACL**
    - default **deny in/outbound traffic**.
    - very rare use cases. not advised to use.
- **Bastion Hosts**
  - public entrypoint. typically firewalled, out to private network.
  - minimize entry points.
  - bastion security group must add **allow in** from **internet**.
  - private subnet security group must **allow in** from **bastion**.
  - ![bastion hosts](img/bastion.PNG)
- **Certificate Manager (AWS)**
  - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>

    - define what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.
    - **AWS managed**: standalone, administered by **AWS**.
    - **Customer managed**: standalone, administered by **you**.
      - Suggested to use managed policies, not inline, to view all policies in the console.
    - **Inline Policy**: you create and manage. embedded in a single IAM identity (user, group, role), exists only on IAM Identity-Based Policy.
  - **Resource-Based Policy**: attach to **AWS resource**. **always inline**. **no managed** policies. (e.g. EC2 read access S3 bucket).
    - define which actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions.
  - ![iam policy](img/iam_policy.PNG)
  - ![iam policy json](img/iam_json.PNG)
  - **ARNs**

  - **Wildcards**: `*` include all. (e.g. `s3:*`, `iam:*AccessKey*`)
- **IAM Role**
  - tool for granting **temporary** access to **AWS resources**.
  - **assumable** by a **person, application, or service**.
  - you must be **granted permission to switch to the role**.
- **IAM User**
  - authentication, assumed programmatically, credentials do expire.
  - IAM user is **person** or **application** that must make **API calls** to AWS products.
  - Each user **must have a unique name** (with no spaces in the name).
- **Identity Federation**
  - user is authenticated by system **external** to the AWS account.
  - allow access **without** having to create IAM users.
  - ![sts idp](img/sts_idp.PNG)
  - **Identity Federation: Three Options**
    1. **AWS STS**: Security Token Service. enables request of **temporary limited-privilege credentials**.
       1. cross account or **federated** access.

- **Security Groups**
  - **Stateful Firewalls**: instance level. policy with **allow/deny rules** to ports and IPv4/IPv6.
  - stand alone policy and can be **attached** to **multiple instances** or **combined** with **other security groups**.
  - **default** inbound:block, outbound:allow.
  - **Scope**: region/VPC.
  - **Errors**
    - **Timeout**: blocked by security group.
    - **Connection Refused**: application error. traffic went through to EC2, but EC2 did not respond.
- **Root User**
  - highest level of privileges. Only one with **default** access to billing information.
  - best practice to not use root.

## Caching

- <a href="#Table-of-Contents">Table of Contents</a>
- **Caching**
  - **high speed data storage layer**.
  - distance from **origin server** to client induces latency.
  - improve performance(high **throughput**) of data retrieval and reduce **latency**. using edge locations.
  - **Best Practice**
    - data that requires **slow, expensive query**.
    - **frequent** request for **static data** that can be **stale** for some time.
  - ![caching 2](img/caching2.PNG)
- **CloudFront**
  - **Content Delivery Network**: globally distributed system of caching servers.
  - AWS CDN(content delivery network) edge network. supports **websockets** and **HTTPS**.
  - **AWS Shield Standard**: extra layer of security(DDOS). resilient. -no extra cost.
  - **AWS Certificate Manager**: create/manage **SSL** certs. -no extra cost.

  - over 200 points-of-presence (PoP), edge locations and **edge caches**. (e.g. share S3 assets all over the world).
  - **Encryption**: turn on **require users to use HTTPS** in transit.
    - **Field-Level Encryption**: encryption at the edge. maintains encryption through entire application stack.
      - the apps that need data, have credentials to decrypt.
  - ![cloudFront](img/cloud_front.PNG)
  - **Setup**: specify **origin server**, configure **distribution**.
  - ![cloudFront start](img/cloud_front_start.PNG)
  - **Edge Cache**: sometimes called **PoP (point of presence)**. **frequent** content, **close** to your users.
  - **Regional Edge Cache**: larger cache so **longer shelf life**. **origin** to Edge Caches.
  - **Expire Content**
    - **TTL**: time-to-live. specify length of time.
    - **Change Object Name**: use versions.
    - **Invalidate Objects**: not recommended. you force delete objects from CDN.
- **Caching Databases**
  - reduce cost, latency, volume of DB reads.
  - **Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**: extremely performant(microsecond-scale response time).
    - adds **in-memory**(RAM) acceleration.
  - ![DAX](img/dax.PNG)
  - **Remote or Side Cache**: adjacent to database.
    - key:value NoSQL in-memory store. typically for **Redis** or **Memcached**. read-heavy workloads.
  - ![side cache](img/side_cache.PNG)
  - **Elasticache**: fully managed, **side cache**. web application(web sessions, state) in-memory data store.
    - supports **engines**: Memcached(**20** cache nodes, horizontal scale, no multiple AZs) and Redis(**250** cache nodes, complex memory types).

    - **cluster**: logical group of nodes.
    - **Scope**: region. multiple AZs.
    - **Lazy Load**: app request Elasticache data. If not exist, app ask database. app writes data to Elasticache.
      - advantages: only requested data is cached. **stale data**.
    - **Write-through**: data is written to database and Elasticache. **real-time data updates**.
    - **TTL**: stale data is updated when TTL expires.
  - ![elasticache](img/elasticache.PNG)
  - ![elasticache cluster](img/elasticache_cluster.PNG)
- **Caching Web Sessions**
  - **sessions**: manage user **authentication** and store **data** while user interacts with application.
  - **Sticky Sessions**: ELB uses cookies to route traffic to instance with session.
    - by default an ELB will route to smallest load, but with sticky sessions, ELB routes to same instance.
    - if instance fails, session is lost.
    - prevents ELB from truly balancing the load.
  - **Distributed Cache**: store session data in cache. solves single-point-failure and load balancing sessions.
    - can also use **DynamoDB** to persist sessions.

  - **EC2 Placement Groups**
    - control Availability Zone where instances run. logical grouping to create **low latency** between running **instances**.
    - instance can launched in only one placement group. **dedicated host** **cannot** run in placement group.
    - **Cluster**: lowest-latency and high packet-per-second network. **same server rack**.
    - **Partition**: low-latency with reduced correlated hardware failure risk. **same or different server racks**.
      - good for low-latency with large volume of instances.
    - **Spread**: low-latency. at least one instance is in **another Availability Zone**.

  - **governance mode**: users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.
  - S3 **versioning** must be **enabled**.
- **S3 Event Notification**
  - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventNotifications.html>
  - receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket.
  - **enable notifications**:

  - ![S3 Tiers](img/S3_tier.PNG)
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**
  - takes advantage of the **globally distributed edge** locations in Amazon **CloudFront**.
- **S3 Uploading**
  - **aws cli**: `aws s3 cp file.txt s3://BUCKET-NAME/file.txt`
  - **Multipart**: tool that splits data into smaller size. `> 100 MB`. network connectivity inconsistent.
  - **Transfer Acceleration**: uses CloudFront edge location, then AWS backbone.
  - **Snowball**: **80 Terabytes** disk storage. physical device shipped to you.
  - **Snowmobile**: **Exabytes** disk storage. 18 wheeler shipping container picks up data.
- **S3 versioning**

  - **Versioning-Suspended**: bucket has been versioned, but suspended.
- **S3 Website**
  - static only(no server). low cost solution to web hosting.
  - **CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)**
    - XML document with rules that identify the origins that are allowed to access your bucket.
