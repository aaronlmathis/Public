## DIKW Hierarchy

Defines the transition of data to information from knowledge to wisdom. (Data Information Knowledge Wisdom)

## Data in DIKW

The input directly received by the user (or computer). It is generally not usable until it has been converted into a relevant form.

## Information in DIKW

Having been inferred from data; one or more processes have been applied to the data to transform it into a more useful form.

## Knowledge in DIKW

Information that has been put to use; information placed into a context. Refined information such that the user of the knowledge is able to call forth only relevant portions of information when needed.

## Wisdom in DIKW

Provides a social setting to knowledge; an understanding of the "why". Can only come by having both knowledge and experience.

## Information Systems

A collection of data and information used to support the management of an organization. Also refers to the technical components and human resources that enable the assembly, storage, and processing of data and the delivery of information. This has existed for a lot longer than computers.

## Characteristics of Quality Data

Relevance - the data being used must apply directly to the decision being made

Timely - data must be efficient and must be provided in a timely manner

Thorough - the data must be complete

Accurate - data should be captured only once, where possible and should be captured as close to the point of activity as possible.

Reliable - data should reflect stable and consistent data collection processes across collections points and over time

## RAM

Stands for Random Access Memory.

It temporarily stores data before it is processed and sent to your screen or printer.
