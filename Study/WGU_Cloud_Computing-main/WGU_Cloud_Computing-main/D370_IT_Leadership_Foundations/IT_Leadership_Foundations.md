- It’s actually really easy to get through! For Task 1 all you do is take an assessment test that takes about 30 minutes to get through. You’ll wind up with five different personality traits and you just right about how all five traits you received in the assessment apply to you. (I personally didn’t read any of the course material, I just skipped that and jumped right into it and followed the exact direction of the rubric.
- Task 2 is going to be about a meeting and the things you observed during it. There’s going to be a video that’s about five minutes long. All you do is watch that, just like Task I once again answer the questions in the rubric and it’ll be an easy pass. Just try not to be super long-winded in your answers. If they’re asking you something for both Tasks just answer the questions right down to what they’re asking. No need to elaborate too much

  - It can be helpful to read chapter 6 for task 1 and chapter 7 for task 2.
  - Task 1 is more of a self-awareness activity and Task 2 is observing leadership in others during a meeting between two teams in conflict.
