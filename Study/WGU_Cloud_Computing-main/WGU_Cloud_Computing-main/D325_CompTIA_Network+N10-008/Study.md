## Electromagnetic Radiation

- amplitude, attenuation, bandwidth, baud rate, bps, electromagnetic radiation, encoding, frequency, hertz, interference, jitter, latency, modulation, noise, signal, spectrum, speed, throughput,

%

- **Amplitude**: distance between low and high states of waveform.
- **Attenuation**: loss of signal strength, expressed in decibels (dBm). strength at origin and signal strength at destination.
- **Bandwidth**: theoretical size of pipe. The narrow definition of bandwidth is a **frequency** range measured in cycles per second or Hertz (Hz), but the term is very widely used in data networking to mean the amount of data that can be transferred, measured multiples of bits per second (bps). Encoding methods mean that, for instance, a signal with 100 MHz frequency bandwidth can transfer much more than 100 Mbps.
- **baud rate**: any signal high to low(called **symbol**) per second.
  - A symbol could be something like a pulse of higher voltage in an electrical current or the transition between the peak and the trough in an electromagnetic wave.
- **bps**: bits per second. data link layer. Can be more than one bit per symbol, so bit rate can be higher than baud rate.
- **Electromagnetic radiation**: means transmitting signals as electric current, infrared light, or radio waves.
- **Encoding**: transitioning between low and high voltage states in an electrical circuit, making use of a characteristic of the wave called amplitude.
- **Frequency**: how many times a second a signal goes from high to low to high.
- **Hertz**: frequency range measured in cycles per second.
- **Interference**: obstruction thats causes signal quality to decrease.
- **Jitter**: delay between packets.
- **Latency**: time it takes packet to arrive from src.
- **Modulation**: encoding information into a transmitted signal.
- **noise**: anything that gets transmitted that isn't the intended signal. expressed as **SNR(signal to noise ratio)**.
- **signal**: Electromagnetic radiation means transmitting signals as electric current, infrared light, or radio waves.
- **Spectrum**: range of radio waves.
- **speed**: is the expected performance of a link. measured in ms. sometimes called latency or delay.
- **throughput**: the tested average data rate achieved over time. actual data transfer.

- **Cat 5** cable is no longer available. Cat 5e is tested at frequencies up to 100 MHz (like Cat 5 was) but to higher overall specifications for attenuation and crosstalk, meaning that the cable is rated to handle Gigabit Ethernet throughput. Cat 5e would still be an acceptable choice for providing network links for workstations.
- **Cat 6A** is an improved specification cable that can support 10 Gbps over 100 m. Cat 6A cable is bulkier than Cat 5e, and the installation requirements more stringent, so fitting it within pathways designed for older cable can be problematic. TIA/EIA standards recommend Cat 6A for use in health care facilities, with Power over Ethernet (PoE) 802.3bt installations, and for horizontal connections to wireless access points.
  - if you are installing Cat 6A wiring, you must also install Cat 6A patch panels, wall plates, and connectors.
- **Cat 7** cable is always of a screened/shielded type and is rated for 10GbE applications up to 100 m (328 feet). Cat 7 is not recognized by TIA/EIA but appears in the cabling standards created by the ISO (ISO/IEC 11801). It must be terminated with GG45 or TERA connectors rather than standard RJ-45 connectors.
- **Cat 8** is intended for use in datacenters only for short patch cable runs that make top-of-rack connections between adjacent appliances. ISO defines two variants; 8.1 (Class I) is equivalent to TIA/EIA Cat 8 and uses RJ-45 connectors while 8.2 (Class II) must use outer shielding or screening and GG-45 or TERA connectors.

## Wireless Networks

- GSM, CMDA
- Cellular chart

%

- **GSM (Global System For Mobiles)**: Cellular technology that takes the voice during a call and converts it into a digital format. Removable SIM card and most popular around the world. In US, used by AT&T and T-Mobile.
- **CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access)**: Cellular technology that uses code division to split up the channel.
  - CDMA is a more powerful and flexible technology than GSM.
    - W-CDMA
      - Wideband CDMA
    - UMTS
      - Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
  - Cannot remove SIM, but new electronic SIM is a cheaper way of getting a data service when overseas.
  - The **preferred roaming list (PRL)** is a database built by CDMA service and most important to connect to network while traveling.

- ![cisco three tiered hierarchy](./img/cisco_three_tier_hierarchy.PNG)
- access/edge layer: allow connection to network. layer 2 switches.
- distribution/aggregation layer: redundant layer 3 switches. full or partial mesh link to each layer 3 switch.
  - implement traffic policies, such as routing boundaries, filtering, or quality of service (QoS).
- core layer: network backbone. layer 3 switches. redundant traffic to network. full mesh with distribution layer 3 switches.

- Traffic flow:
  - North-South: data travels outside the network.
  - East-West: traffic travels inside the network.

- ![Legacy to VoIP](./img/voip_pbx.PNG)
- **PBX**: Private Branch Exchange. automated switchboard providing a single connection point for an organizations voice lines.
  - **Demarc/smartjack/NIU**: Network Interface Unit. where PTSN ends and customers personal network(private network) begins.
  - **CSU/DSU**: Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit. connects to smartjack.
  - **TDM PBX**: hardware.
  - **VoIP PBX**: software on router, pc.
- **POTS**: plain old telephone service. Analog interface phone line terminates at home in. Each line is incoming or outgoing voice. Large business would require hundreds of lines for voice.
- **PSTN**: public switched telephone network. All analog phone calls go through this network.
- **T-Carrier**: multiplex voice on single line. digitized voice. based on TDM.

## SIEM

- (Security Information and Event Management) is a software system that gathers and analyzes activities across your entire IT infrastructure. SIEM gathers security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and other sources.

## QoS uses three layers

1. control
2. data
3. management
